## Update the token endpoint to refresh the user's token when called.

## The token endpoint should probably also just return the user's profile info, rather than needing me as well on the frontend.

## Implement plans and adjust auth to use them.

## Add metrics tracking from the frontend to the backend.

## Get Dynamic Apps working with: /apps/api/src/services/apps that haven't been covered and make sense, in particular, multi step ones could be cool

## Can we get AI to generate dynamic apps? Would that be cool?

# Replicate apps don't wait for a response from the webhook, they'd need to on the frontend

# Apps should have an ID for the response, if you load the page with that ID, it should show the response.

# Fix the autoscroll, it's weird. Probably just implement a virtualised window, that would be better anyway.

# Each message should output and store rufusal and anotations from openai if available.
