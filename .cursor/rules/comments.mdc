# Code Commenting Guidelines:
- Comment should always explain why something is done, not what is done.
- Code should be treated as documentation, only add comments when absoletely necessary.
- Use clear and concise language, avoid redundancy.
- Keep comments up-to-date and in sync with the code.
- Do not remove `TODO` comments unelss you are explicitly asked to.

## Inline Comments

```
// ✅ Good comment: Explains complex business logic
if (user.role === 'admin' && !isHoliday) {
  // Administrators have special permissions on non-holidays
  grantSpecialAccess();
}

// ❌ Bad comment: States the obvious
// Check if the user is an administrator
if (user.role === 'admin') {
  // ...
}
```
