# Project Structure Guide

## Monorepo Structure
- This is a monorepo using PNPM workspaces
- All applications are located in the `apps/` directory
- The project follows a microservices architecture with separate frontend and backend applications

## Applications
- `apps/app`: Frontend React application
- `apps/api`: Backend API using Hono and Cloudflare Workers
- `apps/metrics`: Analytics and metrics application
- `apps/database`: Database schemas and migrations managed with Drizzle, do not generate migrations manually here.

## Development Workflow
- Use `pnpm dev` to start all applications simultaneously
- Use `pnpm dev:app`, `pnpm dev:api`, etc. to start individual applications
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` to maintain code quality before commits

## Deployment
- The applications are deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- Use `pnpm deploy` to deploy all applications
- Use `pnpm deploy:app`, `pnpm deploy:api`, etc. to deploy individual applications
