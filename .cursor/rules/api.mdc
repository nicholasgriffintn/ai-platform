## API:
- We use Hono for our framework, always use that.
- We are using CloudFlare Workers, don't use Node modules, instead reach for Web Standards by default.
- Be sure to always consider input santisation whenever we are taking input from a user.
- Avoid external dependencies unless explicity asked to add them.
