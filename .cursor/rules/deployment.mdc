# Deployment Guidelines

## Cloudflare Workers
- All applications are deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- Each application has its own `wrangler.json` configuration
- Environment variables are managed through `.dev.vars` files locally
- Secrets are managed through Cloudflare's environment variable system

## CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration
- Tests must pass before deployment
- Production deployments happen automatically on merges to main

## Environment Configuration
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Local development uses `.dev.vars` files
- Never commit `.dev.vars` files to the repository, use `.dev.vars.example` instead
- Follow the naming pattern in the `.dev.vars.example` files for new environment variables
