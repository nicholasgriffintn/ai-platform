## Frontend Applications:
- We are using React
- We use React Router, don't make suggestions for other frameworks
- We don't use component libraries like shadcn, we are mostly using in house compoonents with Tailwind
- Avoid external dependencies unless explicity asked to add them
- Use lucide-react for icons, don't use SVGs
- Styling should use the `cn` function in `~/lib/utils`, use this to generate classnames
