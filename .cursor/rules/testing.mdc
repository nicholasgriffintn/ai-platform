# Testing Guidelines

## General Testing Principles
- Use Vitest for all testing
- Aim for high test coverage, especially on critical business logic
- Tests should be deterministic and not rely on external services

## Test Organization
- Place tests in a `__tests__` directory alongside the code being tested
- Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension
- Group related tests with describe blocks
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

## Frontend Testing
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Mock API calls and external dependencies

## API Testing
- Focus on testing endpoints with request/response pairs
- Mock external services when necessary
- Test both success and error scenarios
