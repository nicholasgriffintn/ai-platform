# State Management Guidelines

## Frontend State Management
- Use React hooks for local component state
- For global state, use React Context API with reducers
- Avoid prop drilling; extract shared state to context providers
- Use TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management

## Data Fetching
- Use TanStack Query for all data fetching operations
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Set appropriate stale times and cache invalidation strategies
- Use optimistic updates for mutations when appropriate

## Form State
- Use controlled components for form inputs
- Implement Zod for form validation
- Use React Hook Form for complex forms

## Performance Considerations
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Optimize re-renders with useCallback for event handlers
- Use the React DevTools profiler to identify performance bottlenecks
