# AI Platform

A complete AI platform that makes multiple models available from a single application. It features an API platform that has been built out to provide a range of AI interactions and applications alongside a React frontend and a mobile application (in development).

Check out my write up on this project [here](https://nicholasgriffin.dev/blog/building-my-own-ai-assistant). I've also launched a version of this to try out at [polychat.app](https://polychat.app).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this project is still in active development so there are a few features that are not yet fully working or fully imagined.
> You can [check out our roadmap here](https://github.com/users/nicholasgriffintn/projects/4/views/2).

## Usage Limits

Polychat is configured with usage limits to prevent abuse. These limits are as follows:

- 10 standard messages per day for unauthenticated users
- 50 standard messages per day for authenticated users
- 200 pro tokens per day for authenticated users

Pro tokens are calculated based on a multiplier of the cost of the model. For example, if a model costs $0.01 per 1000 input tokens and $0.05 per 1000 output tokens, then the pro token limit is 200 * (0.01 + 0.05) / 2 = 6.

This equates to around:

- Expensive models (9x): ~22 messages
- Mid-tier models (3x): ~66 messages
- Cheaper models (1-2x): 100-200 messages

If you are providing your own service and would like to change these limits, you can do so by changing the `USAGE_CONFIG` object in the `apps/api/src/constants/app.ts` file.

## API Documentation

The complete API documentation lives in the OpenAPI schema defined in `apps/api/src/openapi/documentation.ts` and served at [api.polychat.app](https://api.polychat.app).

### Quick Example

```bash
curl https://api.polychat.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",

      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Database Management

The application uses a Cloudflare D1 database with Drizzle ORM for schema management and migrations.

### Running Migrations

```bash
cd apps/api
# Migrate to the local database
pnpm run db:migrate:local

# Migrate to the preview database
pnpm run db:migrate:preview

# Migrate to the production database
pnpm run db:migrate:prod
```

To generate a new migration, run:

```bash
pnpm run db:generate
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

The metrics application provides dashboards for monitoring:

- API usage and performance
- Model performance and costs
- User activity and engagement

Access the metrics dashboard at [metrics.polychat.app](https://metrics.polychat.app).
