## Maintenance & Compatibility Improvements

### ✅ Memory Management
- **Cache Size Limits**: All caches have maximum size limits to prevent unbounded growth
- **LRU Eviction**: Oldest entries are automatically removed when limits are reached
- **TTL Cleanup**: Time-based expiration for stale entries
- **No Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup of expired cache entries and timestamps

### ✅ Error Handling
- **Consistent Logging**: Standardized error logging with context
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failed operations don't break core functionality
- **Type Safety**: Proper handling of Promise settlement results
- **Error Context**: Enhanced error information for debugging

### ✅ Code Quality
- **Minimal Comments**: Only kept comments that provide genuine value
- **Clear Variable Names**: Self-documenting code reduces need for comments
- **Consistent Patterns**: Unified approach to caching and error handling
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript usage without overly restrictive types

### ✅ Compatibility
- **Cloudflare Workers**: All patterns work properly in Workers environment
- **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Resource Constraints**: Optimized for Workers memory and CPU limits
- **Request Isolation**: Proper handling of per-request context

## Performance Impact (Maintained)

### Database Operations
