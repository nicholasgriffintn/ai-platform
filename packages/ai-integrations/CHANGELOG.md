# @ngriffin_uk/polychat-ai-integrations

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d70d5d: Everything you give Polychat is now read, filed and searched the same way, whichever door it came in by.

  - **See what Poly knows about a file.** Open any file and choose Knowledge to see where it came from, whether it is searchable yet, its summary and topics, which files it cites, repeats or was made from, and anything that failed with a button to read it again.
  - **Decide how each file is used.** Turn off Use in answers to keep a file without Poly or teammates quoting it, let followed pages remove themselves after a week, a month or three, and mark a file confidential so teammates never see it.
  - **Topics that file themselves.** New files are filed under topics and the people, places and projects they are about. Open a topic from a file's Knowledge panel to see everything filed under it.
  - **Follow a connected service, item by item.** In a project's Files, choose Follow, then A connected service, to follow a Notion database, Google Docs in Drive, a Gmail search, a Slack channel, GitHub issues, Linear issues or a Jira search. Each page, email, message or issue arrives as its own file, unchanged items are skipped, and anything removed upstream is archived.
  - **Search your knowledge bases too.** Connect Cloudflare AI Search or Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases in Plugins and Poly can search them alongside your files without copying them in. Project owners and admins can attach their connection to a project under Follow, How new files are read.
  - **Choose how new files are read.** Summaries, topics and related-file links can each be turned off for your library or a project under Follow, How new files are read.
  - **Finished work is findable.** Documents, decks and sheets Polychat made are searched alongside your sources, and search can be narrowed by kind, origin, topic, folder or date.
  - **Documents in global search.** Search now finds files in your library as well as chats and projects.
  - **Long files no longer slow anything down.** Very long files are kept in file storage and indexed in full, however long they are.
  - **Webhooks for knowledge.** Webhook endpoints can subscribe to files being filed, updated, removed or read through.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 187afde: Discover gathers before it writes, and Poly reads your own services without asking.

  - **A Discover notebook.** Before each morning Poly reads your connected services and researches every topic you follow into a notebook called Discover: one document per service and a dated research document per topic. The morning edition is written from those documents, so a slow or broken service never stops the edition. Open the notebook to see what Discover knows.
  - **Every connected service counts.** Discover now picks from the whole connector catalogue by what you have connected: Last.fm, Readwise, Hardcover, Audiobookshelf, Trakt, Marquee, YouTube, Raindrop, DEV, Oura, Google Calendar or Outlook, Gmail or Outlook newsletters, Google Tasks, Todoist or TickTick, Linear, GitHub, Fathom, WakaTime, OpenWeather, Google Photos, NASA and Artificial Analysis. Where two services cover the same thing, the first connected one is used. Each service shows when it was last read, or why it could not be, in Discover settings, where you can also set where you are for weather.
  - **Marquee.** Connect [Marquee](https://marquee.pashi.app) with an API token under Plugins. Poly can read your shelf, what is on tonight and the week ahead, search the catalogue, and, with your approval, save to your shelf or follow a name.
  - **No more approvals for reading your own accounts.** Poly, in your personal space, reads your connected accounts without a separate grant or an approval. Scheduled runs never create approvals; an operation that would need one is left out with a note instead of stalling the run.
  - **Last.fm and Trakt remember who you are.** Both connectors now take your username alongside the key, so Discover and Poly no longer have to ask.
  - **Interests are researched overnight.** Discover works out three to five interests from what you have been doing, favouring what you do outside Polychat over chats about it, and researches each one before the morning, so every interest has fresh reading on day one.
  - **More kinds of card.** Episodes airing, releases and gigs appear under Coming up; videos and podcast episodes under Watching and listening; newsletters worth a minute under Reading with the sender named. Each opens a chat with the right first step, such as adding an event to your calendar.
  - **An evening edition.** Turn it on in Discover settings for a second, shorter edition at 19:00 that looks at tomorrow. It never makes an episode or a Perch.
  - **Poly knows your week.** Poly's own thread and its daily look around read what Discover gathered, so Poly can be specific about what you have been listening to, reading and watching without re-reading your services.
  - **File things in a notebook from anywhere.** Ask Poly to put a page, a note or some files in a notebook by name, and it will, creating the notebook only when you ask.
  - **Send Studio work on.** A finished report, deck or table in a notebook's Studio has a Send menu for Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets and DEV when they are connected. Each send runs through the notebook chat and asks before it writes.
  - **Marquee records what you watch.** Tell Poly what you watched, are watching or want to see, with a rating and your thoughts, and it saves that to your Marquee shelf after you approve. Connectors without live discovery, such as Marquee, Last.fm and Trakt, now tell Poly their operations and fields instead of failing.
  - **A real feed.** Discover now reads the day's headlines for where you are and, when Reddit is connected, the best posts from your communities. Every interest is researched from the news of the last three days, with the publisher and date kept. Poly's picks lead the edition, and up to three stories per interest and from Reddit fill the Reading section beneath them, never repeating a link you have already seen. Your recent chats only shape the edition when nothing else is known about you yet.
  - **Discover reads the articles, not just the headlines.** Each page the overnight research finds is read in full and filed in the Discover notebook, and the edition is written from what the pages actually say, in plain prose rather than page markup. Opening a read card talks to the filed article, so Poly can give you the gist or the other side without fetching anything, and cards show the site's icon. Newsletters and Reddit posts carry their text too, so a card can tell you what happened rather than that something did.
  - **The Perch and Your week talk about the things, not about their notes.** The round-up now has the full text of the articles behind the day's reading and spends its time on what they report; Your week is built from what your documents, notebooks and chats actually contain, so it can say what you worked out rather than what it was not told.
  - **Episodes finish.** Chapters are now written and voiced one after another instead of all at once, so a later chapter no longer loses its save to an earlier one and sits on Queued. Your week shows its cover on the shelf and sits beside The Perch.
  - **Episode chapters say what they are about.** The chapter list shows what each chapter covers rather than the illustrator's notes, and Your week leaves out generated files it cannot describe.
  - **An edition is never lost to one bad link.** A page the feed cannot show as a card, such as a plain http address, is left out rather than making the whole edition unreadable, and an edition is checked before it is saved so a problem names the exact card.
  - **Failures say why.** A service that answers with an error, including a rate limit, is recorded as a failed read with the reason, and a connector that cannot be reached says what went wrong.
  - **Discover documents explain themselves.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook now reads as a page: when it was read and what was found. A service that could not be read says why. YouTube is read as your subscriptions and recent likes rather than your own uploads.
  - **Fixes.** The first edition after enabling Discover now gathers from your services before it is written, instead of being composed from recent chat titles alone. The Perch's captions follow the audio instead of jumping to the end, and loading a skill with a leading slash in its path no longer fails.

- e0ca7c6: Long work is no longer thrown away by arbitrary limits.

  - **Runs finish.** Hosted agents (Pi, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenAI Agents, Bedrock) are no longer stopped after 15 or 60 minutes, and native agents on Polychat Desktop are no longer cut off after 10 minutes. Stopping a run still stops it.
  - **Slow providers and tools get to answer.** Model, OCR, guardrail and reranking requests no longer give up after 30–120 seconds, Composio actions after 20 seconds, Composio file transfers after 15 seconds, or MCP tool calls after 15 seconds. Connecting to an MCP server still times out, so a dead server cannot hold up a chat.
  - **Delegates hand back everything.** A delegate's final answer reaches the parent conversation in full instead of its first 2,000 characters, and delegation goals and progress messages are no longer capped.
  - **Longer messages from other agents.** A2A and MCP callers can send teammates messages over 8,000 characters, and hosted agents receive your whole message and the full instructions rather than their last 100,000 and 12,000 characters.
  - **Drafts are not rejected for being a little long.** Decks, tables, mind maps, flashcards, quizzes, video overviews, notebook guides and memory maintenance no longer fail when a title or line runs past a character limit. Web search answers and memory maintenance are no longer cut short by a fixed output limit.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 911642e: Clearer setup for plugins that connect with an API key.

  - **Callback URL.** The connect dialog shows a callback URL you can copy. If the provider asks for a callback or redirect URL when you create the key, paste this one in.
  - **One box per credential.** Plugins that need more than one value now ask for each separately. Podcast Index asks for its API key and API secret, and Audiobookshelf for its server address and API token, so there's no need to join them with a colon or bar yourself.

- 1fe4222: Discover gathers before it writes, and Poly reads your own services without asking.

  - **A Discover notebook.** Before each morning Poly reads your connected services and researches every topic you follow into a notebook called Discover: one document per service and a dated research document per topic. The morning edition is written from those documents, so a slow or broken service never stops the edition. Open the notebook to see what Discover knows.
  - **Every connected service counts.** Discover now picks from the whole connector catalogue by what you have connected: Last.fm, Readwise, Hardcover, Audiobookshelf, Trakt, Marquee, YouTube, Raindrop, DEV, Oura, Google Calendar or Outlook, Gmail or Outlook newsletters, Google Tasks, Todoist or TickTick, Linear, GitHub, Fathom, WakaTime, OpenWeather, Google Photos, NASA and Artificial Analysis. Where two services cover the same thing, the first connected one is used. Each service shows when it was last read, or why it could not be, in Discover settings, where you can also set where you are for weather.

  - **No more approvals for reading your own accounts.** Poly, in your personal space, reads your connected accounts without a separate grant or an approval. Scheduled runs never create approvals; an operation that would need one is left out with a note instead of stalling the run.

  - **Send Studio work on.** A finished report, deck or table in a notebook's Studio has a Send menu for Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets and DEV when they are connected. Each send runs through the notebook chat and asks before it writes.
  - **Marquee records what you watch.** Tell Poly what you watched, are watching or want to see, with a rating and your thoughts, and it saves that to your Marquee shelf after you approve. Connectors without live discovery, such as Marquee, Last.fm and Trakt, now tell Poly their operations and fields instead of failing.
  - **A real feed.** Discover now reads the day's headlines for where you are, the front page of Hacker News, and, when Reddit is connected, the best posts from your communities. Every interest is researched from the news of the last three days, with the publisher and date kept. Poly's picks lead the edition, and up to three stories per interest, Reddit and Hacker News fill the Reading section beneath them, never repeating a link you have already seen. Your recent chats only shape the edition when nothing else is known about you yet.
  - **Discover documents explain themselves.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook now reads as a page: when it was read, what was found, and the raw result underneath. A service that could not be read says why. YouTube is read as your subscriptions and recent likes rather than your own uploads.
  - **Fixes.** The first edition after enabling Discover now gathers from your services before it is written, instead of being composed from recent chat titles alone. The Perch's captions follow the audio instead of jumping to the end, and loading a skill with a leading slash in its path no longer fails.

- 06c02dd: Discover is your morning edition from Poly. Open Discover in the Chat sidebar, turn it on, and each morning Poly leaves a brief, painted topic tiles, reading, automations worth setting up and the odd check-in, built from what you've been talking about.

  - Pick any card to open it beside the feed with its own conversation, then tell Discover more, less or never. Follow a topic and it gets a notebook that collects each day's best links.
  - The Perch is a short two-host round-up of each edition, in your podcast show and its private feed.
  - Today's episode is a narrated, illustrated part of a five-day season on your top topic, with chapters, camera moves and a listen-only mode. Save a season as one long listen for your podcast app.
  - Wind down makes a five, ten or twenty minute breathing, body-scan or unwind session for the evening. It starts speaking within seconds, over quiet music made for the session that you can turn off.
  - Today's episode, The Perch and Wind down share one player beside the feed, and keep playing while you read other cards.
  - Connect Readwise, Last.fm, Trakt, Hardcover or Podcast Index, and Discover reads what you're reading, listening to and watching. Notebooks can now keep connected sources up to date.
  - From before cards bring back flashcards you missed, links you saved a while ago and what you were doing a year ago.
  - On Sundays, Your week is a short private recap of what you made, learned and finished.
  - Turn on Tell me when it's ready and Poly lets you know on your phone and connected channels when the edition lands.
  - Settings lists your connected services, each with its own switch for Discover. Oura and Audiobookshelf can now be connected too, and on iPhone Discover can use yesterday's Apple Health summary for the brief.
  - Health, sexuality, religion, politics and money only appear when you follow them or ask. Episodes and their quizzes and flashcards land in a followed topic's notebook, and episodes open in Files with the same player.
  - Audio and video across chat, Files and notebooks now use one player.
  - The product tour now lives at /tour. On iOS, Discover is in the menu and there is a Today widget.
  - Long structured generations no longer give up after 100 seconds, so episodes and other background work finish instead of failing part way.
  - Podcasts and episodes now show their real length and jump to the right place when you scrub or resume.
  - Background work interrupted part way, by a deploy or a crash, now picks up again instead of sitting unfinished.

- 80fee8e: MCP tools can now show their own interface in a conversation, and Polychat can be used as a tool from other assistants.

  - **Apps inside the chat.** When a connected MCP integration ships an interface for a tool (the MCP Apps extension), Polychat renders it in the reply in a sandboxed frame: pickers, tables, small dashboards. The app can refresh its own data through read-only tools; anything that would change something still goes through the conversation so it can ask you first.
  - **Polychat as an MCP server.** Point Claude, ChatGPT, Codex or any MCP client at the /mcp endpoint with a Polychat API key and it can run the same tools you can run in Polychat, and ask any of your teammates to take on a job. Anything that needs approval waits for you in Polychat.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e820856: MCP tool results keep their PNG, JPEG and WebP images for models that read images, and tool-result images reach every provider as real image input instead of serialised base64 text. MCP server settings offer Inspo as a one-click server for design references.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c4ed1e: Move Composio and the connector provider abstraction out of the API. `library-composio` owns the configured toolkit catalogue, its schema, the session handle contract and the `composio:sync` script, and `ai-integrations` owns the connector provider registry, operation and approval policy, write-outcome classification, API-key executors, the Composio REST and trigger clients, and the Pashi contract, catalogue and client. The API keeps connection authority, approvals, the private file bridge, run lifecycle, persistence and the function tool surfaces, and consumes both packages through `ai-integrations`.
- 251ac59: Use remote MCP servers with any model. When MCP is enabled and the model has no hosted MCP tool, or a server's credential belongs to Polychat, the turn gets `mcp_list_tools` and `mcp_call_tool`, which call the server directly through a new Streamable HTTP client. Calls are classed as writes, so they follow the same approvals as other external writes, and only the tools a connection allows can run. MCP connections can now sign in with OAuth (discovery, dynamic client registration, PKCE and refresh) with tokens stored encrypted, and token connections can be kept for Polychat instead of OpenAI.
