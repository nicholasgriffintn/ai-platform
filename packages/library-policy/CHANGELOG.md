## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 67b52ed: Let people approve a Poly write once and for all, for one destination. When Poly at the assistant level waits on a write with a known destination, the approval card offers "Always allow here". The server derives the tool and destination from the stored pending call and keeps the approval on the Poly context for thirty days, where a Cedar condition lets matching writes run unattended. Sends, spending, deletes, credentials and exports still ask every time. Approvals are listed in Poly's autonomy menu and can be revoked there.
- 07290f2: Add a teammate autonomy dial. A teammate context can be an observer, an assistant or a partner, enforced by Cedar over each call's effect class: observers only read and draft, assistants ask before writes, partners write within their grants, and sends, spending, deletes, credentials and exports always ask. Poly starts as an assistant and its overlay can change the level. Run triggers now reach tool availability and execution, so Poly's navigation gate holds there too.

### Patch Changes

- 6966643: Grant selected actions from existing connectors directly to projects through Plugins, without creating a recipe. Reuse personal accounts, the connector catalogue, project capabilities and existing execution approvals. Preserve exclusions and narrower recipe permissions.
