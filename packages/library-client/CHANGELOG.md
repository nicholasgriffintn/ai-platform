## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b2929f: Confirm your date of birth before your first message.

  - **Asked once, at the right moment.** The first time you send a message, signed in or not, on the web, desktop or iPhone, Polychat asks for your date of birth. It keeps only whether you meet the minimum age of 18, never the date, and the answer can't be changed later.
  - **Skip if you're just looking.** Skip the question and you can keep browsing, but you can't send messages until you answer it. Polychat asks again the next time you try to send one.
  - **Why we ask.** A new page at `/age-check` explains why we ask, what we keep and your rights in the UK and EU. The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy now say plainly that Polychat is for people aged 18 or over.
  - **Same rule on the API.** Creating a response, sending input to one and calling chat completions all return 403 until the age check is done, for API keys and anonymous sessions alike. Read or record it with `GET` and `POST /auth/age`.
  - **Self-hosting.** Set `AGE_GATE_ENABLED` to `false` in your Worker vars to turn the check off completely.

- 8b965f6: Polychat now speaks in the best voice your account can reach. Read-aloud, the speech tool, podcasts and video overviews all pick the highest-rated speech model you have access to, ranked by the Artificial Analysis text-to-speech arena. Add an ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Mistral or Amazon Polly key and your audio upgrades on its own.

  - New speech models: ElevenLabs Eleven v4, v4 Turbo, v3, Multilingual v2 and Flash v2.5, Cartesia Sonic 3.6, Mistral Voxtral 3 TTS and Amazon Polly Generative.
  - Audio settings now separate the provider, the model and the voice. Leave the provider on Automatic, or pick one and choose a model and voice from its list.
  - Podcasts use distinct host and guest voices on every provider, and video overviews use a narrator voice.
  - Notebook guides, Studio outputs and podcast scripts now use the medium model tier on your keys rather than the cheapest background model.

- 7accf45: Pull typed values out of text and images with Cloudflare's Clairic.

  - **Extraction models.** Clairic joins the catalogue as the first extraction model. Give it some text, or up to four images, and a list of named fields, and it returns each one as the type you asked for: a span of the text, a number, a date, a duration, a list, or an estimate or forecast with an 80% range. Anything the input does not say comes back empty with a best guess, never made up.
  - **`POST /extractions`.** Send `state`, `fields` and optional `images` and `reference_date`. Every scalar answer carries `confidence` and `p_null`, so you can decide in code which values to trust.
  - **Extract values tool.** Chat, Poly and automations can call `extract_values` to read order numbers, totals and dates from an email or invoice in one fast call, then hand the values to `decide`.
  - **Paperwork.** A new app for receipts, invoices and damage claims. Drop in photos or paste text, and each figure comes back with a confidence, the source highlighted where it was found, a running total and a CSV export.

- bf39c94: Poly can now make slide decks and spreadsheets, not just documents. Ask for a deck or a sheet and it lands in Files, where you can flip through the slides, switch between tables, revise it in conversation and download it as Markdown or CSV. Spreadsheet downloads are safe to open, since text that looks like a formula is kept as text.

  Research now checks your own Sources and synced accounts alongside the web, and shows what it found from them beside the report. Your passages stay with Polychat and are never sent to the research provider.

- f4841cd: Files is now one library instead of tabs inside tabs. Everything you have given Polychat, everything it made and everything it remembers sits in a single grid or list, with All, Made, Sources and Memory as quick filters.

  - Make something new from the top of Files in one click: upload, write a note, start a memory, create a folder, make a podcast episode, or open Image studio and Replicate.
  - Drop files anywhere on Files, or on a folder, to add them.
  - Every item has a menu for opening its file, copying a share link, renaming, adding it to a folder and deleting it. Results Polychat made can now be renamed and deleted too.
  - Collections are now folders, shown above your files. A podcast show is a folder with its RSS feed controls on the folder page.
  - Search filters by name as you type, and a type filter, sort order and grid or list view sit beside it. In a project, search can also look inside files.
  - Memories open on their own page, every save is a revision, and you can name them in plain words.

- 80fee8e: MCP tools can now show their own interface in a conversation, and Polychat can be used as a tool from other assistants.

  - **Apps inside the chat.** When a connected MCP integration ships an interface for a tool (the MCP Apps extension), Polychat renders it in the reply in a sandboxed frame: pickers, tables, small dashboards. The app can refresh its own data through read-only tools; anything that would change something still goes through the conversation so it can ask you first.
  - **Polychat as an MCP server.** Point Claude, ChatGPT, Codex or any MCP client at the /mcp endpoint with a Polychat API key and it can run the same tools you can run in Polychat, and ask any of your teammates to take on a job. Anything that needs approval waits for you in Polychat.

- 8b965f6: Conversation groups are now notebooks. Click a notebook's name in the sidebar to open it: your sources on the left, the chat in the middle and Studio on the right. Every chat in a notebook answers from the sources you tick, names the source behind each claim, and can search the notebook's earlier chats too.

  - Add sources from Files, uploads, web pages or pasted text, or search the web from the notebook. Fast research finds pages to pick from; deep research writes a report in the background and brings back the pages it cites.
  - Studio makes audio overviews, slide decks, video overviews, mind maps, reports, flashcards, quizzes, infographics and data tables from the ticked sources. The pencil on each tile lets you choose the format, length, style, language and focus.
  - Flashcards and quizzes remember how you got on. Click any topic in a mind map to ask about it.
  - Save any reply as a note, and turn a note into a source when you want chats to read it.
  - Configure a notebook to answer as a learning guide or a persona of your own, at the length you like, from its sources only or with the web as well.

- 0a57f73: Open any file and ask about it.

  - **One viewer for every file.** Documents, sources, recordings, images and memories all open in the same viewer. The title menu holds file info, version history, share links and every conversation about the file. Files opened from a chat, a run or a task open on top of where you were.
  - **Ask about this file.** The viewer has its own conversation. Polychat reads the file fresh on every turn, can revise a document as a new revision you can restore, and keeps the conversation with the file so you can pick it up later.
  - **Poly knows the page you are on.** Each place has a guide Poly reads whenever you ask it something there, and a fresh Poly conversation opens with that guide and a few starters. Your first chat opens with the guide to conversations.
  - **API.** Pass `conversation.subject` with `{ type, id }` when creating a response to start a conversation about a source, output or memory, and list them with `GET /conversations?subject_type=&subject_id=`. `GET /skills/guides` returns each place's guide.

- 11381a9: Teammates are now people you message, not settings you edit.

  - **Teammate threads.** Opening a teammate opens its own conversation, which carries on between visits. The sidebar lists the teammates you are talking to and your groups, newest activity first, with anyone who needs you at the top. Those conversations no longer also appear in the chat list. The conversation uses the same workspace as any other chat, and its side panel sums up the teammate: what it is doing, its autonomy, and how many routines and connections it has, each a click from Working context.
  - **Groups.** Use "Add a teammate" on a teammate's page to put two to six teammates in one conversation. Use @name, or tap a name in the header, to choose who answers. Every reply shows which teammate wrote it, and messages teammates send back while they work collapse into one "Messages from…" line you can open.
  - **Reactions.** React to a reply from the smiley button, or long-press on iOS. 👍 and 👎 also tell the teammate how it did, and teammates react 👀 to your message when they pick it up instead of replying "On it". A reaction never approves anything.
  - **Receipts.** When a tool sends, books, pays, deletes or changes something, the conversation shows a short receipt such as "Created routine · Friday inbox tidy · every Friday at 09:00", with the full output one click away.
  - **Live with teammates.** Live now works in teammate and group conversations. Start it from the Live button and stop it from the same place; each spoken turn goes to the teammate with its tools, and anything it wants to do still waits for your approval.
  - **Slack and Telegram signals.** Connected channels react 👀 when a message is picked up, show a working status in Slack threads and swap to ⚠️ if the run fails. Choose "Also ✅ when it is done" or "No reactions" when you connect a channel.
  - **More teammates to hire.** New jobs for personal admin, productivity, sales and marketing, operations and engineering, including Inbox tidy, Trip watcher, Morning brief, Meeting prep, Bug reproduction and Expense manager. Each arrives with its own character and offers to set up its routine.
  - **Dry runs.** Run any set-up routine as a dry run. Anything that would send, write, spend or delete returns a draft instead, so you can check a routine before it goes live.
  - **Batch review.** When three or more approvals are waiting, tick the ones you want and approve them together. Each is still approved on its own, exactly as listed.

- 7b36da1: Sources is now where your media lives. Files' Given tab is renamed Sources and gains Podcasts, Image Studio and Replicate alongside the library.

  - Upload images, audio and video straight into Sources. Open any audio or video source to play it, transcribe it, write notes with decisions and action items, and make cover art. The transcript becomes searchable, so recordings work as grounding like any other source. This replaces the Recording Processor app.
  - Image Studio, sketch-to-painting and Replicate runs now save what they make into Sources, where it can be reused as material. They have moved out of Apps and the Canvas sidebar item into Files › Sources.
  - Make podcasts from your sources: pick sources, a format (deep dive, brief, debate or critique) and a length, and two hosts talk it through. Each episode lands in Sources with its audio, transcript, show notes and cover.
  - Group episodes into shows and create a private RSS feed link to subscribe in any podcast app. Making a new link turns off the old one.
  - Ask Poly or a teammate to make an episode with the new podcast tool, or install the Podcast Briefing recipe to get a fresh episode on your topics or Sources on a schedule.

- 7a9f872: Teammates and routines now show what they cost and can be given a monthly budget.

  - **Spend on the teammate page.** A teammate's card shows the credits its runs have used this month, and the working context has a Spend section with the same figure against its cap.
  - **Monthly caps.** Set a cap in credits on a teammate's working context or on a routine. Once the month's spend reaches it, new runs are refused with a note saying why, a routine over its cap pauses itself with the reason shown, and everything resumes when the month resets or you raise the cap.
  - **Runs remember their routine.** Each run records which routine started it, so routine spend is exact rather than estimated.

- 7accf45: Mistral speech now runs on Voxtral 3, with a hosted voice agent for Live.

  - **Transcription.** Mistral transcription uses Voxtral Mini Transcribe 3, and you can pick Voxtral Small Transcribe 3 in Settings for higher accuracy. It detects the spoken language rather than assuming English, and timed transcripts now label who said what.
  - **Custom vocabulary.** Add names, acronyms and jargon under Settings → Audio, one per line, and Mistral transcription, live transcription and the voice agent will listen out for them.
  - **Live transcription.** Mistral live transcription uses Voxtral Mini Transcribe Realtime 3. Notes labels each speaker as they talk, and Live conversations use Mistral's own end-of-turn detection, so a thoughtful pause no longer cuts you off.
  - **Mistral Voice Agent.** Pick Mistral Voice in Live for a hosted Voxtral 3 agent that listens, searches the web when it needs to and answers aloud. It uses your Mistral key or the platform one, and you can interrupt it mid-sentence.
  - **Speech.** Mistral speech uses Voxtral TTS 3 with its new preset voices in over 20 languages. The default is Mary (English, UK). Choose how expressive the delivery is under Settings → Audio.
  - **Your voices.** Save a voice from an MP3 or WAV recording under Settings → Audio and use it for speech. Only you can use your saved voices, and you need to confirm the voice is yours or you have permission. The API offers the same through `/audio/voices`, and `/audio/speech` accepts `expressiveness`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 82c133e: Eval suites can run as a provider batch on OpenAI and Anthropic routes, at about half the price, with results within 24 hours. A new `batch` provider category wraps the OpenAI Batch API and Anthropic Message Batches.
- 7bec25b: Add Polychat Benchmarks: GeoGuess, Countdown, Fermi Bets, Long Odds, Hamster Wheel and Strudel Groove, run on one engine for official, personal and workspace scopes. Results at `/benchmarks` show intervals, Artificial Analysis indexes with attribution, measured cost and a medal table, people can play the auto-scored benchmarks and vote on blind pairs, the Benchmarks app runs them against your own models and keys, and the model selector previews each model's standings.
- 65fbf81: Refresh the realtime providers and Note Taker. Notes dictation now runs on the shared live session with any ready transcription provider and commits OpenAI turns on silence. Gemini Live defaults to Gemini 3.8 Live, OpenAI transcription sends the `languages` field and drops the retired Whisper and GPT-4o models, translation sessions use the dedicated translations endpoints, and proxied transcription sessions settle billing on their measured audio instead of a flat reservation. The proxy audio cap now covers the full session length, Notes lists return excerpts with server-side search, metadata is only described once a note has enough text, and the unused video analysis options are gone.

### Patch Changes

- e41549c: Keep transcription timings. Providers return segments and words, `/audio/transcribe?timestamps=true` includes them, notes from media quote real `[m:ss]` markers instead of guessing, and recordings play captions and download them as SRT or VTT.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ead2cc: Import GitHub and Linear issues into Work and review exact GitHub PR revisions manually or through signed automatic intake. Retain captured Sources and review Outputs, isolate each workspace and credential owner, and approve publication separately.

  Apply migration `0061_project_task_integrations` before deployment. Configure the GitHub webhook secret and pull-request events for automatic intake, and pull-request write permission for publication.

- dd4389b: Let React artifacts show live data and charts. An artifact can declare read-only connector reads in a leading `<bindings>` block and read them with `usePolychatData` from `@polychat/data`. The host runs each read through the API, which takes the declaration from the stored message, refuses operations that change anything, only lets a refetch change declared arguments, caches results for a minute and rate-limits each artifact. React artifacts now compile with Sucrase instead of Babel standalone, can import `recharts`, and are assembled without string replacement, so `$` sequences and `</script>` in component source no longer corrupt the page.
- c126d04: Add model governance to Work. Workspaces can search Hugging Face, import models and datasets pinned to a commit, and review static inspection evidence that never loads the weights. Approvals follow versioned policies with dry runs, exceptions and expiry. Suites can be compared across serving routes with confidence intervals, and fine-tunes run on Hugging Face Jobs from governed conversation snapshots with lineage and a compute record. Approved versions can be served on dedicated Inference Endpoints, drift is caught by nightly replays, and any route or version exports as a CycloneDX ML-BOM. Workspaces can enforce approved routes in project chats, and generations carry route and version tags. Each workspace connects its own Hugging Face account or organisation under Govern, with the platform token as an optional default, and retiring a deployed route deletes its endpoint. Training moves from Profile to Models › Build, and Hub staging for Bedrock imports is keyed by commit.
- 90f7110: Turn Work › Models into a model platform on the workspace's own provider accounts. Connect Hugging Face, AWS, Together, Fireworks, Nebius, Google Vertex, Azure AI Foundry, RunPod, Cloudflare Workers AI or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, then upload weights or register them from a bucket, build governed datasets from files, the Hub, buckets, rated conversations or a teacher model, and train with supervised, preference, reinforcement, distillation, embedding, merge or quantise runs after comparing trainers on fit and cost. Deployments are sized and priced per host, serve through aliases with eval gates, canaries and rollback, and appear in chat as models. Governance adds per-action permissions with separation of duties, budgets with spend approval, idle pause, revocation across lineage, erasure requests, an audit trail and CycloneDX, SPDX, model card and training content exports.

  The personal Training app, the training Worker and `component-experiences/training` are removed, and the API now mounts the platform under `/model-platform`.

- 251ac59: Use remote MCP servers with any model. When MCP is enabled and the model has no hosted MCP tool, or a server's credential belongs to Polychat, the turn gets `mcp_list_tools` and `mcp_call_tool`, which call the server directly through a new Streamable HTTP client. Calls are classed as writes, so they follow the same approvals as other external writes, and only the tools a connection allows can run. MCP connections can now sign in with OAuth (discovery, dynamic client registration, PKCE and refresh) with tokens stored encrypted, and token connections can be kept for Polychat instead of OpenAI.
- 67b52ed: Give Poly an agenda. `GET /poly/agenda` derives what needs the person, what Poly is working on and what it finished this week from the Poly thread's delegations, goal and latest run, with no new storage. Poly's prompt carries the agenda each turn, the overlay shows it above the thread, and the sidebar's Ask Poly button shows Poly's status. The agenda refreshes on the live delegation, goal and run events for the Poly thread.
- ee31a6d: Make Poly a platform teammate with one continuous thread per person. `POLY_TEAMMATE` is synced like the other platform teammates but kept out of rosters, `GET /poly/home` opens the person's Poly context and its `poly` home conversation, and the overlay always opens that thread through the Poly teammate. Poly runs only in its owner's thread, a Poly thread only runs as Poly, and navigation tools are offered only on turns the person started.
- 67b52ed: Let people approve a Poly write once and for all, for one destination. When Poly at the assistant level waits on a write with a known destination, the approval card offers "Always allow here". The server derives the tool and destination from the stored pending call and keeps the approval on the Poly context for thirty days, where a Cedar condition lets matching writes run unattended. Sends, spending, deletes, credentials and exports still ask every time. Approvals are listed in Poly's autonomy menu and can be revoked there.
- 462cbe7: Queue follow-ups while a Chat reply is running. The composer stays open during a reply and queues what you type, up to ten messages per conversation, listed above the composer and removable. Queued messages are held as suspended `queued_chat_message` tasks and the next one is released when the run ends, so they send in order even after the tab closes. Work keeps steering the run instead.
- e4ba666: Start a recipe from any service with a private webhook URL. Each webhook can carry an "only run when" condition, can be paused, rotated or deleted, and honours an Idempotency-Key header so retries do not run twice. Payloads reach the recipe as untrusted data and never carry authority. Composio and webhook events now share one admission path.
- 77a5ee5: Shared conversation links now stop at the moment you shared them. Messages sent afterwards stay private until you choose Update link, and stopping sharing retires the link so sharing again issues a new one. Public reads are sent with no-store, no-referrer and noindex headers.
- 57f8a16: Add Sites, a generative site builder that works from one brief. Jev classifies the brief into a plan (kind, scope, tone, palette, model tier), a tier-selected coding model streams the site as JSON Patch lines against a guardrailed component catalogue, and the shell renders every patch the moment it lands. `library-sites` holds the catalogue, patch stream compiler, validator and repair, prompt assembly, theme tokens and a deterministic Next.js and Tailwind code generator; `component-sites` holds the live React registry, themed preview and code view. Sites persist as revisioned outputs, refine in follow-ups, export as runnable project files, and hand off to a project's sandbox for a full build. The SSE buffer parser now lives once in `utility-core`. Sites are interactive (state, bindings, visibility, repeat, filters and actions in both the live renderer and the generated code), editable in place through an element inspector with zero-token edits and scoped refinement, exportable straight to a pull request with generated images, embeddable in chat through the `build_site` tool, revisioned with restore and public preview links, and judged by Jev at planning, refinement, quality-scoring and prompt-evaluation time.
- 07290f2: Add a teammate autonomy dial. A teammate context can be an observer, an assistant or a partner, enforced by Cedar over each call's effect class: observers only read and draft, assistants ask before writes, partners write within their grants, and sends, spending, deletes, credentials and exports always ask. Poly starts as an assistant and its overlay can change the level. Run triggers now reach tool availability and execution, so Poly's navigation gate holds there too.

### Patch Changes

- b4c0c65: Add user feedback capture to telemetry. `captureAiFeedback` fans thumbs feedback out to a new AI Gateway sink that patches the stored log (when the message has a log id) and to PostHog as a survey response linked to the chat run trace that produced the message. Provider generation events now use the chat run as `$ai_trace_id` (falling back to the conversation) so feedback and generations link in AI Observability. The chat feedback endpoint accepts a `message_id`, resolves the message, run id, log id and trace id on the backend, and attributes feedback to the latest assistant message when clients send only the conversation. The frontend sends the message id and always shows feedback prompts on assistant messages.
- f933fa8: Keep the desktop app signed in as you. A host can now hand the client its own access-token source, which is always sent as a Bearer token and renewed before a request goes out stale. The desktop window no longer lands as an anonymous free user under `tauri dev`, or after waking from sleep, and drops back to sign-in only when the API rejects the session. A failed network check no longer signs anyone out, and signing out of the desktop app now revokes the server session too.
- 169e2f5: Add the Polychat CLI, which pairs a terminal, server or gateway through a device code instead of a pasted API key, and show it on the downloads page. The device approval page now shows the code as cells, the requesting client, its expiry and what approval grants. Device sign-in clients no longer trip bot detection when they start and poll.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 42c36ea: Release the applications from changesets. Merging a changeset that names an application versions it, tags it and publishes a GitHub release with its changelog entry; the desktop release also carries macOS, Windows and Linux archives built on their own runners. The API serves those archives from `/desktop/downloads` and answers the desktop updater from `/desktop/releases`, so neither the website nor the application needs to know where the builds are hosted.
- 293b1ca: Add `withRetry`, `parseRetryAfterHeaderMs`, and `parseRetryAfterBodyMs` to the retry subpath. Callers supply their own retryable-status policy, so existing retry behaviour is unchanged.
- 7d3c809: Share one connected navigation shell between the web and desktop applications.

  `component-shell` is a new package holding the wiring layer that previously lived only in `apps/app`: the chat sidebar with its conversation list and menus, the product and conversation headers, the page and product shells, global search, the settings popover and the not-found page. It is the single exception to the router-, store- and client-free rule for `component-*` packages, because connecting the controlled presentation in `component-navigation` and `component-ui` to the stores and router is its whole job.

  What differs between hosts arrives through `ShellHostProvider`: the origin public share links point at, the dialogs a host owns alone, and the actions that open them. A host that has not migrated an action supplies one that throws, so a gap stays visible instead of becoming a control that quietly does nothing.

  `library-react` publishes `DISCOVER_PATH` alongside the existing place paths, and `library-client` publishes `WEB_APP_BASE_URL` so a host without a web origin can still build share links.

  `component-conversation` drops `ConversationHeader`. It was the desktop's stand-in for a real header and is replaced by the shared `ConversationProductHeader`.
