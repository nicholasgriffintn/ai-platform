## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d70d5d: Everything you give Polychat is now read, filed and searched the same way, whichever door it came in by.

  - **See what Poly knows about a file.** Open any file and choose Knowledge to see where it came from, whether it is searchable yet, its summary and topics, which files it cites, repeats or was made from, and anything that failed with a button to read it again.
  - **Decide how each file is used.** Turn off Use in answers to keep a file without Poly or teammates quoting it, let followed pages remove themselves after a week, a month or three, and mark a file confidential so teammates never see it.
  - **Topics that file themselves.** New files are filed under topics and the people, places and projects they are about. Open a topic from a file's Knowledge panel to see everything filed under it.
  - **Follow a connected service, item by item.** In a project's Files, choose Follow, then A connected service, to follow a Notion database, Google Docs in Drive, a Gmail search, a Slack channel, GitHub issues, Linear issues or a Jira search. Each page, email, message or issue arrives as its own file, unchanged items are skipped, and anything removed upstream is archived.
  - **Search your knowledge bases too.** Connect Cloudflare AI Search or Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases in Plugins and Poly can search them alongside your files without copying them in. Project owners and admins can attach their connection to a project under Follow, How new files are read.
  - **Choose how new files are read.** Summaries, topics and related-file links can each be turned off for your library or a project under Follow, How new files are read.
  - **Finished work is findable.** Documents, decks and sheets Polychat made are searched alongside your sources, and search can be narrowed by kind, origin, topic, folder or date.
  - **Documents in global search.** Search now finds files in your library as well as chats and projects.
  - **Long files no longer slow anything down.** Very long files are kept in file storage and indexed in full, however long they are.
  - **Webhooks for knowledge.** Webhook endpoints can subscribe to files being filed, updated, removed or read through.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b965f6: Conversation groups are now notebooks. Click a notebook's name in the sidebar to open it: your sources on the left, the chat in the middle and Studio on the right. Every chat in a notebook answers from the sources you tick, names the source behind each claim, and can search the notebook's earlier chats too.

  - Add sources from Files, uploads, web pages or pasted text, or search the web from the notebook. Fast research finds pages to pick from; deep research writes a report in the background and brings back the pages it cites.
  - Studio makes audio overviews, slide decks, video overviews, mind maps, reports, flashcards, quizzes, infographics and data tables from the ticked sources. The pencil on each tile lets you choose the format, length, style, language and focus.
  - Flashcards and quizzes remember how you got on. Click any topic in a mind map to ask about it.
  - Save any reply as a note, and turn a note into a source when you want chats to read it.
  - Configure a notebook to answer as a learning guide or a persona of your own, at the length you like, from its sources only or with the web as well.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 1df361b: Remove unused public exports and dead helpers, consolidate duplicated duration, identifier, status, model-grouping, JSON, SMS and timing-safe comparison logic into shared modules, narrow the desktop backend option types to the interfaces each runner uses, and surface previously silent validation and rewrite failures in the UI.
- de24f4b: Filter global search by kind, and show unread Attention counts in both sidebars.

  - The search dialog shows filter chips (All, Chats, Projects, Workspaces, Capabilities), each with a count. Only kinds present in the results are offered, and arrow keys and Enter work on the filtered list.
  - `SidebarNavLink` accepts `count` and `countLabel`, and `component-navigation` exports `SidebarCountBadge`. The badge caps at 99+ and gives screen readers a text label (an `aria-label` on a plain `<span>` isn't reliably announced).
  - The Chat sidebar's Attention link and the Work sidebar's Attention link (`WorkSidebarNav` `attentionCount`) show the unread notification count. The per-project Tasks badge uses the same component.

### Patch Changes

- b105d00: Keep search filters usable when results change and preserve keyboard activation of dialog controls. Prioritise blocked and review tasks consistently across project overviews and boards.

  Preserve task drafts after failed saves, prevent duplicate submissions, and distinguish saved tasks from failed starts. Follow task creation links on an open board and show Attention loading and notification errors accurately.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4789c96: Let anyone sign out from the shell, and let the desktop window sign out at all.

  The desktop application had a `sign_out` command in Rust that nothing ever called. A signed-in window held its session in the operating system keychain with no way to give it back, so the only way off an account was to delete the credential by hand. On the web, signing out was buried in the profile page.

  The sidebar settings popover now carries a sign-out entry beside the account links, and `ShellHost` gains a required `signOut` so each host does what signing out means for it: the web ends the session through the API, and the desktop ends it through the API _and_ forgets the keychain entry, so a window that cannot reach the API still stops holding the credential.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 588f262: Add a conversation list actions menu that archives or restores everything matching the current filters.

  `component-navigation` gains `ConversationListActions`, a kebab menu that sits beside the filter control. It offers "Archive all (N)" on an active list and "Restore all (N)" on an archived one, and withholds the action under the mixed `all` status where the count would not describe what changes.

  `schemas` publishes `bulkArchiveChatCompletionsJsonSchema` for the new `PATCH /chat/completions` endpoint, which matches on the same title and activity filters as the list and only moves conversations that are not already in the requested state. `ConversationListPage` now carries `total`, so a count can describe the whole filtered set rather than the loaded page.

  `compareConversationsBySort` is exported so clients can order a list the same way the API does, rather than re-sorting by date and dropping the title sort.

- ac5b12e: Replace the conversation list's stacked selects with a nested options menu, and extend what it can filter.

  `component-ui` gains `OptionsMenu`, a submenu-per-setting menu whose rows carry their current value and check the selected option. `ConversationListControls` now takes a single `filters` object plus `onFiltersChange` and `onReset` instead of one prop pair per setting, and adds a last-activity window and a grouping choice alongside status and sort. `ConversationGroup` requires an `id` and treats `title` as optional so an ungrouped list renders without headings.

  `schemas` publishes `conversationArchiveFilterSchema`, `conversationSortBySchema`, and `conversationActivityWindowSchema`. The activity window is resolved to an absolute cutoff by whoever owns the calendar: `conversationActivityCutoff` returns the local start-of-day boundary, and clients send it as an `updated_after` timestamp rather than asking the API to interpret a symbolic window. `filterConversationsByListOptions` applies the same cutoff to device-local conversations, honours the new title sort, and accepts an explicit `now`.

- 6334297: Move the shipped render implementations into their packages and replace the placeholder interfaces.

  Host seams added so render modules stay portable:

  - `component-ui` exposes `LinkProvider`, `Link`, and `NavLink`; hosts pass resolved hrefs and supply
    their own router.
  - `library-surface` defines `SurfaceAnalytics`, and `library-react` exposes `AnalyticsProvider` and
    `useAnalytics`, so render modules report events without knowing the provider.
  - `component-content` exposes `CustomResponseViewProvider`, so tool responses that need host data
    are registered by the application and unknown names fall back to the raw JSON view.

  Render ownership:

  - `component-ui`: page shell frame and header registry, page primitives, empty and sign-in states,
    loading spinner, page skeletons, and the file uploader presentation.
  - `component-models`: the provider icon registry and `ProviderGlyph`, Artificial Analysis panel,
    model options and lists, auto-router picker, hover preview, and the controlled selector trigger
    and panel.
  - `component-navigation`: sidebar parts, settings popover, theme and more-options menus,
    conversation list and controls, storage notice, and the search dialog.
  - `component-capabilities`: capability and app cards, experience grid, capability theme helpers,
    dynamic tool form, tool configuration dialog, tool result card, and the recipe card and dialogs.
  - `component-content`: generated response views, artefact classification, actions, callout, inline
    preview, document editor, and the sandboxed artefact renderers.
  - `component-conversation`: message content, actions, tool and function messages, citations,
    reasoning, search grounding, connector approval, agent trace, composer input and menus, council
    controls, keyboard shortcuts, and the welcome screen.
  - `component-account`: account sidebar shell, agent, team, connector, and provider views, the user
    settings form, and the provider and connector credential modals.
  - `component-workspaces`: workspace and project cards, member, invitation, governance, knowledge,
    coding environment, and activity views, Work sidebar navigation, and the create/invite dialogs.
  - `component-experiences`: article, note, and podcast presentation under `/content`; canvas and
    drawing under `/media`; the Strudel player under `/music` with the runtime as an optional peer;
    training panels and forms under `/training`.

  Shared behaviour moved below the render layer:

  - `schemas`: chat modes, model selection, region variants, provider display, token formatting,
    auto-router modes, reasoning helpers, recipe presentation, article report contracts, connector
    approval parsing, and model tool configuration parsing.
  - `library-chat`: the conversation message contract plus message, artefact, agent-trace, opinion,
    branching, compaction, speech, composer-command, and tool-result helpers, each on its own subpath.
  - `utility-core` gains `generateId`, `formatBytes`, and `getErrorMessage`; `utility-react` gains
    `useFileUpload` and `containsEventTarget`.

### Patch Changes

  libraries, render modules, tooling presets, and publishable package interfaces.
