## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4789c96: Let anyone sign out from the shell, and let the desktop window sign out at all.

  The desktop application had a `sign_out` command in Rust that nothing ever called. A signed-in window held its session in the operating system keychain with no way to give it back, so the only way off an account was to delete the credential by hand. On the web, signing out was buried in the profile page.

  The sidebar settings popover now carries a sign-out entry beside the account links, and `ShellHost` gains a required `signOut` so each host does what signing out means for it: the web ends the session through the API, and the desktop ends it through the API _and_ forgets the keychain entry, so a window that cannot reach the API still stops holding the credential.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 588f262: Add a conversation list actions menu that archives or restores everything matching the current filters.

  `component-navigation` gains `ConversationListActions`, a kebab menu that sits beside the filter control. It offers "Archive all (N)" on an active list and "Restore all (N)" on an archived one, and withholds the action under the mixed `all` status where the count would not describe what changes.

  `schemas` publishes `bulkArchiveChatCompletionsJsonSchema` for the new `PATCH /chat/completions` endpoint, which matches on the same title and activity filters as the list and only moves conversations that are not already in the requested state. `ConversationListPage` now carries `total`, so a count can describe the whole filtered set rather than the loaded page.

  `compareConversationsBySort` is exported so clients can order a list the same way the API does, rather than re-sorting by date and dropping the title sort.

- ac5b12e: Replace the conversation list's stacked selects with a nested options menu, and extend what it can filter.

  `component-ui` gains `OptionsMenu`, a submenu-per-setting menu whose rows carry their current value and check the selected option. `ConversationListControls` now takes a single `filters` object plus `onFiltersChange` and `onReset` instead of one prop pair per setting, and adds a last-activity window and a grouping choice alongside status and sort. `ConversationGroup` requires an `id` and treats `title` as optional so an ungrouped list renders without headings.

  `schemas` publishes `conversationArchiveFilterSchema`, `conversationSortBySchema`, and `conversationActivityWindowSchema`. The activity window is resolved to an absolute cutoff by whoever owns the calendar: `conversationActivityCutoff` returns the local start-of-day boundary, and clients send it as an `updated_after` timestamp rather than asking the API to interpret a symbolic window. `filterConversationsByListOptions` applies the same cutoff to device-local conversations, honours the new title sort, and accepts an explicit `now`.

- 6334297: Move the shipped render implementations into their packages and replace the placeholder interfaces.

  Host seams added so render modules stay portable:

  - `component-ui` exposes `LinkProvider`, `Link`, and `NavLink`; hosts pass resolved hrefs and supply
    their own router.
  - `library-surface` defines `SurfaceAnalytics`, and `library-react` exposes `AnalyticsProvider` and
    `useAnalytics`, so render modules report events without knowing the provider.
  - `component-content` exposes `CustomResponseViewProvider`, so tool responses that need host data
    are registered by the application and unknown names fall back to the raw JSON view.

  Render ownership:

  - `component-ui`: page shell frame and header registry, page primitives, empty and sign-in states,
    loading spinner, page skeletons, and the file uploader presentation.
  - `component-models`: the provider icon registry and `ProviderGlyph`, Artificial Analysis panel,
    model options and lists, auto-router picker, hover preview, and the controlled selector trigger
    and panel.
  - `component-navigation`: sidebar parts, settings popover, theme and more-options menus,
    conversation list and controls, storage notice, and the search dialog.
  - `component-capabilities`: capability and app cards, experience grid, capability theme helpers,
    dynamic tool form, tool configuration dialog, tool result card, and the recipe card and dialogs.
  - `component-content`: generated response views, artefact classification, actions, callout, inline
    preview, document editor, and the sandboxed artefact renderers.
  - `component-conversation`: message content, actions, tool and function messages, citations,
    reasoning, search grounding, connector approval, agent trace, composer input and menus, council
    controls, keyboard shortcuts, and the welcome screen.
  - `component-account`: account sidebar shell, agent, team, connector, and provider views, the user
    settings form, and the provider and connector credential modals.
  - `component-workspaces`: workspace and project cards, member, invitation, governance, knowledge,
    coding environment, and activity views, Work sidebar navigation, and the create/invite dialogs.
  - `component-experiences`: article, note, and podcast presentation under `/content`; canvas and
    drawing under `/media`; the Strudel player under `/music` with the runtime as an optional peer;
    training panels and forms under `/training`.

  Shared behaviour moved below the render layer:

  - `schemas`: chat modes, model selection, region variants, provider display, token formatting,
    auto-router modes, reasoning helpers, recipe presentation, article report contracts, connector
    approval parsing, and model tool configuration parsing.
  - `library-chat`: the conversation message contract plus message, artefact, agent-trace, opinion,
    branching, compaction, speech, composer-command, and tool-result helpers, each on its own subpath.
  - `utility-core` gains `generateId`, `formatBytes`, and `getErrorMessage`; `utility-react` gains
    `useFileUpload` and `containsEventTarget`.
