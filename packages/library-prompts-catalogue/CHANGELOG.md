## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 06c02dd: Discover is your morning edition from Poly. Open Discover in the Chat sidebar, turn it on, and each morning Poly leaves a brief, painted topic tiles, reading, automations worth setting up and the odd check-in, built from what you've been talking about.

  - Pick any card to open it beside the feed with its own conversation, then tell Discover more, less or never. Follow a topic and it gets a notebook that collects each day's best links.
  - The Perch is a short two-host round-up of each edition, in your podcast show and its private feed.
  - Today's episode is a narrated, illustrated part of a five-day season on your top topic, with chapters, camera moves and a listen-only mode. Save a season as one long listen for your podcast app.
  - Wind down makes a five, ten or twenty minute breathing, body-scan or unwind session for the evening. It starts speaking within seconds, over quiet music made for the session that you can turn off.
  - Today's episode, The Perch and Wind down share one player beside the feed, and keep playing while you read other cards.
  - Connect Readwise, Last.fm, Trakt, Hardcover or Podcast Index, and Discover reads what you're reading, listening to and watching. Notebooks can now keep connected sources up to date.
  - From before cards bring back flashcards you missed, links you saved a while ago and what you were doing a year ago.
  - On Sundays, Your week is a short private recap of what you made, learned and finished.
  - Turn on Tell me when it's ready and Poly lets you know on your phone and connected channels when the edition lands.
  - Settings lists your connected services, each with its own switch for Discover. Oura and Audiobookshelf can now be connected too, and on iPhone Discover can use yesterday's Apple Health summary for the brief.
  - Health, sexuality, religion, politics and money only appear when you follow them or ask. Episodes and their quizzes and flashcards land in a followed topic's notebook, and episodes open in Files with the same player.
  - Audio and video across chat, Files and notebooks now use one player.
  - The product tour now lives at /tour. On iOS, Discover is in the menu and there is a Today widget.
  - Long structured generations no longer give up after 100 seconds, so episodes and other background work finish instead of failing part way.
  - Podcasts and episodes now show their real length and jump to the right place when you scrub or resume.
  - Background work interrupted part way, by a deploy or a crash, now picks up again instead of sitting unfinished.

- 8b965f6: Conversation groups are now notebooks. Click a notebook's name in the sidebar to open it: your sources on the left, the chat in the middle and Studio on the right. Every chat in a notebook answers from the sources you tick, names the source behind each claim, and can search the notebook's earlier chats too.

  - Add sources from Files, uploads, web pages or pasted text, or search the web from the notebook. Fast research finds pages to pick from; deep research writes a report in the background and brings back the pages it cites.
  - Studio makes audio overviews, slide decks, video overviews, mind maps, reports, flashcards, quizzes, infographics and data tables from the ticked sources. The pencil on each tile lets you choose the format, length, style, language and focus.
  - Flashcards and quizzes remember how you got on. Click any topic in a mind map to ask about it.
  - Save any reply as a note, and turn a note into a source when you want chats to read it.
  - Configure a notebook to answer as a learning guide or a persona of your own, at the length you like, from its sources only or with the web as well.

- 11381a9: Teammates are now people you message, not settings you edit.

  - **Teammate threads.** Opening a teammate opens its own conversation, which carries on between visits. The sidebar lists the teammates you are talking to and your groups, newest activity first, with anyone who needs you at the top. Those conversations no longer also appear in the chat list. The conversation uses the same workspace as any other chat, and its side panel sums up the teammate: what it is doing, its autonomy, and how many routines and connections it has, each a click from Working context.
  - **Groups.** Use "Add a teammate" on a teammate's page to put two to six teammates in one conversation. Use @name, or tap a name in the header, to choose who answers. Every reply shows which teammate wrote it, and messages teammates send back while they work collapse into one "Messages from…" line you can open.
  - **Reactions.** React to a reply from the smiley button, or long-press on iOS. 👍 and 👎 also tell the teammate how it did, and teammates react 👀 to your message when they pick it up instead of replying "On it". A reaction never approves anything.
  - **Receipts.** When a tool sends, books, pays, deletes or changes something, the conversation shows a short receipt such as "Created routine · Friday inbox tidy · every Friday at 09:00", with the full output one click away.
  - **Live with teammates.** Live now works in teammate and group conversations. Start it from the Live button and stop it from the same place; each spoken turn goes to the teammate with its tools, and anything it wants to do still waits for your approval.
  - **Slack and Telegram signals.** Connected channels react 👀 when a message is picked up, show a working status in Slack threads and swap to ⚠️ if the run fails. Choose "Also ✅ when it is done" or "No reactions" when you connect a channel.
  - **More teammates to hire.** New jobs for personal admin, productivity, sales and marketing, operations and engineering, including Inbox tidy, Trip watcher, Morning brief, Meeting prep, Bug reproduction and Expense manager. Each arrives with its own character and offers to set up its routine.
  - **Dry runs.** Run any set-up routine as a dry run. Anything that would send, write, spend or delete returns a draft instead, so you can check a routine before it goes live.
  - **Batch review.** When three or more approvals are waiting, tick the ones you want and approve them together. Each is still approved on its own, exactly as listed.

- 91c7d3d: Choose how the assistant responds without writing a prompt.

  - **Style controls.** Personalised responses now has dropdowns for base style and tone (Professional, Friendly, Candid, Quirky, Efficient, Nerdy or Cynical), warmth, enthusiasm, emoji, and headers and lists. Leave any on Default to keep the assistant's usual behaviour.
  - **Custom instructions on top.** Your own traits and preferences sit below the controls and are added to the style you pick, so you can choose a tone and still add anything the controls do not cover. Instructions you have already written carry on working unchanged.

- 7b36da1: Sources is now where your media lives. Files' Given tab is renamed Sources and gains Podcasts, Image Studio and Replicate alongside the library.

  - Upload images, audio and video straight into Sources. Open any audio or video source to play it, transcribe it, write notes with decisions and action items, and make cover art. The transcript becomes searchable, so recordings work as grounding like any other source. This replaces the Recording Processor app.
  - Image Studio, sketch-to-painting and Replicate runs now save what they make into Sources, where it can be reused as material. They have moved out of Apps and the Canvas sidebar item into Files › Sources.
  - Make podcasts from your sources: pick sources, a format (deep dive, brief, debate or critique) and a length, and two hosts talk it through. Each episode lands in Sources with its audio, transcript, show notes and cover.
  - Group episodes into shows and create a private RSS feed link to subscribe in any podcast app. Making a new link turns off the old one.
  - Ask Poly or a teammate to make an episode with the new podcast tool, or install the Podcast Briefing recipe to get a fresh episode on your topics or Sources on a schedule.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e757d4: Attached documents that would take more than three quarters of the model's context window are replaced with a digest instead of failing the message. Each 50,000-character part is summarised in parallel with the auxiliary model, an overview is built from those summaries, failed parts are named rather than dropped, and complete digests are cached per user by content hash.
- 65fbf81: Refresh the realtime providers and Note Taker. Notes dictation now runs on the shared live session with any ready transcription provider and commits OpenAI turns on silence. Gemini Live defaults to Gemini 3.8 Live, OpenAI transcription sends the `languages` field and drops the retired Whisper and GPT-4o models, translation sessions use the dedicated translations endpoints, and proxied transcription sessions settle billing on their measured audio instead of a flat reservation. The proxy audio cap now covers the full session length, Notes lists return excerpts with server-side search, metadata is only described once a note has enough text, and the unused video analysis options are gone.
- b97c227: Recording summaries now come from the auxiliary model as structured notes: a summary, the decisions and the action items with owner and due date when the recording states them. In a project, each action item can be added to the task board.

### Patch Changes

- 04c071a: Sites browser verification now fails a Hero that runs past the first desktop screen and copy that touches the screen edge on mobile, and the site prompt asks for a Hero that fits the first viewport.
- e41549c: Keep transcription timings. Providers return segments and words, `/audio/transcribe?timestamps=true` includes them, notes from media quote real `[m:ss]` markers instead of guessing, and recordings play captions and download them as SRT or VTT.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 33133cc: Centralise every authored prompt in a catalogue and a retrieval package. `library-prompts-catalogue` holds all prompt text and fragments as data with a validating schema, variables and conditionals; `ai-prompts` retrieves entries by id, task or variant, renders `{{variable}}` templates, and composes the chat, meta-assistant, sandbox, memory, document, agent, sandbox-worker, provider and panel prompts. Hardcoded prompts are removed from `ai-providers` (image styles and guardrail policies), `ai-functions` (task system prompts), `ai-agents`, `schemas` (council member prompts, teammate and platform teammate briefs) and the API and sandbox worker services, which now source their text from the catalogue.
- d25fd94: Let people reach Polychat by email. A personal email binding is keyed by the address you write from, linked with the usual one-time command, and answered by threaded plain-text replies. Inbound mail arrives through the Worker email handler and is only accepted when a DKIM signature aligned with its From domain also covers the To or Cc header naming Polychat's inbox, so forged senders and replayed messages are refused. Auto-replies are ignored to avoid loops.
- 462cbe7: Stop saving blank assistant replies. When a model finishes a step with no visible text and no tool calls, the agent loop retries the request once, then asks for a tool-free answer from what the conversation already holds, and finally writes a plain notice if both come back empty. Every attempt's usage is billed with the turn, and empty replies are logged as `empty_model_response`.
- 67b52ed: Give Poly an agenda. `GET /poly/agenda` derives what needs the person, what Poly is working on and what it finished this week from the Poly thread's delegations, goal and latest run, with no new storage. Poly's prompt carries the agenda each turn, the overlay shows it above the thread, and the sidebar's Ask Poly button shows Poly's status. The agenda refreshes on the live delegation, goal and run events for the Poly thread.
- 67b52ed: Budget Poly's interruptions. Routines Poly sets up from its thread now report back to it, and each routine result passes through a judged, budgeted handoff before it reaches the person: results waiting on them always interrupt, failures and results a decision policy rates as urgent interrupt within five a day and thirty minutes apart, and everything else is noted quietly. Each occurrence is decided once and recorded as a `poly.handoffs` activity on the Poly thread, and the agenda, Poly's prompt and the overlay list what was noted and why.
- ee31a6d: Make Poly a platform teammate with one continuous thread per person. `POLY_TEAMMATE` is synced like the other platform teammates but kept out of rosters, `GET /poly/home` opens the person's Poly context and its `poly` home conversation, and the overlay always opens that thread through the Poly teammate. Poly runs only in its owner's thread, a Poly thread only runs as Poly, and navigation tools are offered only on turns the person started.
- ee31a6d: Call the Poly by its name everywhere. The `meta` conversation type is now `poly`, the `meta_assistant` request field is now `poly`, and the meta assistant contracts, prompts, tools, hooks and overlay are renamed to match (`POLY_NAVIGATION_TOOL_NAMES`, `polyRequestSchema`, `buildPolyPrompt`, `PolyOverlay`, `usePolyNavigation`). A data migration moves stored `meta` conversations to `poly`. Behaviour is unchanged.
- ee31a6d: Let Poly do things in its thread. Poly's grants now cover delegation, goals, memory, research, documents, notes, skills and automations alongside navigation, its thread uses the standard chat prompt with its persona and memory, and `buildStandardChatPrompt` takes a `poly` option that adds Poly's behaviour and the person's current place. `buildPolyPrompt` is removed.
- 57f8a16: Add Sites, a generative site builder that works from one brief. Jev classifies the brief into a plan (kind, scope, tone, palette, model tier), a tier-selected coding model streams the site as JSON Patch lines against a guardrailed component catalogue, and the shell renders every patch the moment it lands. `library-sites` holds the catalogue, patch stream compiler, validator and repair, prompt assembly, theme tokens and a deterministic Next.js and Tailwind code generator; `component-sites` holds the live React registry, themed preview and code view. Sites persist as revisioned outputs, refine in follow-ups, export as runnable project files, and hand off to a project's sandbox for a full build. The SSE buffer parser now lives once in `utility-core`. Sites are interactive (state, bindings, visibility, repeat, filters and actions in both the live renderer and the generated code), editable in place through an element inspector with zero-token edits and scoped refinement, exportable straight to a pull request with generated images, embeddable in chat through the `build_site` tool, revisioned with restore and public preview links, and judged by Jev at planning, refinement, quality-scoring and prompt-evaluation time.
