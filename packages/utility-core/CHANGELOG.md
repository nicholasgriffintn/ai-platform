## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b2929f: Confirm your date of birth before your first message.

  - **Asked once, at the right moment.** The first time you send a message, signed in or not, on the web, desktop or iPhone, Polychat asks for your date of birth. It keeps only whether you meet the minimum age of 18, never the date, and the answer can't be changed later.
  - **Skip if you're just looking.** Skip the question and you can keep browsing, but you can't send messages until you answer it. Polychat asks again the next time you try to send one.
  - **Why we ask.** A new page at `/age-check` explains why we ask, what we keep and your rights in the UK and EU. The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy now say plainly that Polychat is for people aged 18 or over.
  - **Same rule on the API.** Creating a response, sending input to one and calling chat completions all return 403 until the age check is done, for API keys and anonymous sessions alike. Read or record it with `GET` and `POST /auth/age`.
  - **Self-hosting.** Set `AGE_GATE_ENABLED` to `false` in your Worker vars to turn the check off completely.

- 7accf45: Pull typed values out of text and images with Cloudflare's Clairic.

  - **Extraction models.** Clairic joins the catalogue as the first extraction model. Give it some text, or up to four images, and a list of named fields, and it returns each one as the type you asked for: a span of the text, a number, a date, a duration, a list, or an estimate or forecast with an 80% range. Anything the input does not say comes back empty with a best guess, never made up.
  - **`POST /extractions`.** Send `state`, `fields` and optional `images` and `reference_date`. Every scalar answer carries `confidence` and `p_null`, so you can decide in code which values to trust.
  - **Extract values tool.** Chat, Poly and automations can call `extract_values` to read order numbers, totals and dates from an email or invoice in one fast call, then hand the values to `decide`.
  - **Paperwork.** A new app for receipts, invoices and damage claims. Drop in photos or paste text, and each figure comes back with a confidence, the source highlighted where it was found, a running total and a CSV export.

- bf39c94: Poly can now make slide decks and spreadsheets, not just documents. Ask for a deck or a sheet and it lands in Files, where you can flip through the slides, switch between tables, revise it in conversation and download it as Markdown or CSV. Spreadsheet downloads are safe to open, since text that looks like a formula is kept as text.

  Research now checks your own Sources and synced accounts alongside the web, and shows what it found from them beside the report. Your passages stay with Polychat and are never sent to the research provider.

- f4841cd: Files is now one library instead of tabs inside tabs. Everything you have given Polychat, everything it made and everything it remembers sits in a single grid or list, with All, Made, Sources and Memory as quick filters.

  - Make something new from the top of Files in one click: upload, write a note, start a memory, create a folder, make a podcast episode, or open Image studio and Replicate.
  - Drop files anywhere on Files, or on a folder, to add them.
  - Every item has a menu for opening its file, copying a share link, renaming, adding it to a folder and deleting it. Results Polychat made can now be renamed and deleted too.
  - Collections are now folders, shown above your files. A podcast show is a folder with its RSS feed controls on the folder page.
  - Search filters by name as you type, and a type filter, sort order and grid or list view sit beside it. In a project, search can also look inside files.
  - Memories open on their own page, every save is a revision, and you can name them in plain words.

- 8b965f6: Conversation groups are now notebooks. Click a notebook's name in the sidebar to open it: your sources on the left, the chat in the middle and Studio on the right. Every chat in a notebook answers from the sources you tick, names the source behind each claim, and can search the notebook's earlier chats too.

  - Add sources from Files, uploads, web pages or pasted text, or search the web from the notebook. Fast research finds pages to pick from; deep research writes a report in the background and brings back the pages it cites.
  - Studio makes audio overviews, slide decks, video overviews, mind maps, reports, flashcards, quizzes, infographics and data tables from the ticked sources. The pencil on each tile lets you choose the format, length, style, language and focus.
  - Flashcards and quizzes remember how you got on. Click any topic in a mind map to ask about it.
  - Save any reply as a note, and turn a note into a source when you want chats to read it.
  - Configure a notebook to answer as a learning guide or a persona of your own, at the length you like, from its sources only or with the web as well.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 82c133e: Eval suites can run as a provider batch on OpenAI and Anthropic routes, at about half the price, with results within 24 hours. A new `batch` provider category wraps the OpenAI Batch API and Anthropic Message Batches.
- 393652d: Image generation takes a `seed`, picks one when none is given, and reports it with the result, so the model can reuse it when the person asks to tweak an image and keep the composition.
- 7bec25b: Add Polychat Benchmarks: GeoGuess, Countdown, Fermi Bets, Long Odds, Hamster Wheel and Strudel Groove, run on one engine for official, personal and workspace scopes. Results at `/benchmarks` show intervals, Artificial Analysis indexes with attribution, measured cost and a medal table, people can play the auto-scored benchmarks and vote on blind pairs, the Benchmarks app runs them against your own models and keys, and the model selector previews each model's standings.
- c965c69: Sites can borrow colours and fonts from a public reference page. The computer sandbox reads the page's computed background, text, accent colours and font families, and the theme gains an optional custom palette and Google Fonts families that render over the named presets.
- 06e4619: Add two deterministic graders for summaries: `fact_coverage` scores the share of required facts (one per line in the case's expected value) an answer keeps, and `grounded_numbers` scores the share of the answer's numbers that appear in the case input.
- e41549c: Keep transcription timings. Providers return segments and words, `/audio/transcribe?timestamps=true` includes them, notes from media quote real `[m:ss]` markers instead of guessing, and recordings play captions and download them as SRT or VTT.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 6967a07: Host agent harnesses on Polychat's own ports. The agent worker now runs the Pi and OpenCode harnesses and a Hermes container behind one RPC contract, with models served by the API's OpenAI-compatible `/agents/model` port, workspace tools gated by the permission mode, and every reply streamed into chat as it is generated. OpenAI Agents joins as a remote harness through the same `agent-harness` chat provider. The sandbox worker moves to Sandbox SDK 1.0 with app-owned `Workspace` and `Computer` classes, absorbs the computer worker, and keeps caches and browser profiles with `DirectoryBackup`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 297b848: Expose dependency-neutral safe JSON parsing for reuse across Workers and server utilities.
- 462cbe7: Let the model search earlier conversations. `search_conversations` returns one excerpt per matching conversation with its title and date, scoped to the user's personal chats or, inside a project, to that project after an access check. It is on by default for signed-in chats. The unused, unescaped `MessageRepository.searchMessages` is replaced by the scoped query, and `excerptAround` joins the shared string helpers.
- c126d04: Add model governance to Work. Workspaces can search Hugging Face, import models and datasets pinned to a commit, and review static inspection evidence that never loads the weights. Approvals follow versioned policies with dry runs, exceptions and expiry. Suites can be compared across serving routes with confidence intervals, and fine-tunes run on Hugging Face Jobs from governed conversation snapshots with lineage and a compute record. Approved versions can be served on dedicated Inference Endpoints, drift is caught by nightly replays, and any route or version exports as a CycloneDX ML-BOM. Workspaces can enforce approved routes in project chats, and generations carry route and version tags. Each workspace connects its own Hugging Face account or organisation under Govern, with the platform token as an optional default, and retiring a deployed route deletes its endpoint. Training moves from Profile to Models › Build, and Hub staging for Bedrock imports is keyed by commit.
- 90f7110: Turn Work › Models into a model platform on the workspace's own provider accounts. Connect Hugging Face, AWS, Together, Fireworks, Nebius, Google Vertex, Azure AI Foundry, RunPod, Cloudflare Workers AI or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, then upload weights or register them from a bucket, build governed datasets from files, the Hub, buckets, rated conversations or a teacher model, and train with supervised, preference, reinforcement, distillation, embedding, merge or quantise runs after comparing trainers on fit and cost. Deployments are sized and priced per host, serve through aliases with eval gates, canaries and rollback, and appear in chat as models. Governance adds per-action permissions with separation of duties, budgets with spend approval, idle pause, revocation across lineage, erasure requests, an audit trail and CycloneDX, SPDX, model card and training content exports.

  The personal Training app, the training Worker and `component-experiences/training` are removed, and the API now mounts the platform under `/model-platform`.

- 1df361b: Remove unused public exports and dead helpers, consolidate duplicated duration, identifier, status, model-grouping, JSON, SMS and timing-safe comparison logic into shared modules, narrow the desktop backend option types to the interfaces each runner uses, and surface previously silent validation and rewrite failures in the UI.
- 57f8a16: Add Sites, a generative site builder that works from one brief. Jev classifies the brief into a plan (kind, scope, tone, palette, model tier), a tier-selected coding model streams the site as JSON Patch lines against a guardrailed component catalogue, and the shell renders every patch the moment it lands. `library-sites` holds the catalogue, patch stream compiler, validator and repair, prompt assembly, theme tokens and a deterministic Next.js and Tailwind code generator; `component-sites` holds the live React registry, themed preview and code view. Sites persist as revisioned outputs, refine in follow-ups, export as runnable project files, and hand off to a project's sandbox for a full build. The SSE buffer parser now lives once in `utility-core`. Sites are interactive (state, bindings, visibility, repeat, filters and actions in both the live renderer and the generated code), editable in place through an element inspector with zero-token edits and scoped refinement, exportable straight to a pull request with generated images, embeddable in chat through the `build_site` tool, revisioned with restore and public preview links, and judged by Jev at planning, refinement, quality-scoring and prompt-evaluation time.

### Patch Changes

- 4968623: Add the sandbox primitives. `library-sandbox` collects the mechanisms the API, sandbox Worker and computer Worker each carried: the dynamic Worker evaluation template and content-addressed code ids, outbound policy with a virtual tools origin, lease fences, HMAC-signed grants, execution control with pause and cancel, output redaction and request helpers. `ai-sandbox` composes them over Cloudflare's Worker Loader into `createEvaluator`, the loopback `OutboundGateway` entrypoint and `createCodeMode`. The API gains the `run_code` tool (backed by the `LOADER` binding) that runs model-written JavaScript in a fresh isolate and routes `tools.<name>(args)` calls back through the function registry. The computer Worker now fences leases and signs screen grants through the library and reports stale leases by code; the sandbox Worker uses the shared execution control, cancellation and redaction, and verifies JWTs with `@ngriffin_uk/auth-jwt` instead of a hand-rolled HS256 check.
- b105d00: Paginate flagged dataset rows correctly and preserve remaining warnings when excluding rows. Recalculate revision statistics, reject invalid indexes, reuse repeated exclusions, and recover partial saves without duplicating files.

  Preserve selections after failed actions, open the resulting revision after success, and show dataset loading errors. Fail missing upload previews promptly and cancel source streams when previews stop early.

  Associate switch labels and descriptions automatically when no explicit control ID is supplied.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 42c36ea: Release the applications from changesets. Merging a changeset that names an application versions it, tags it and publishes a GitHub release with its changelog entry; the desktop release also carries macOS, Windows and Linux archives built on their own runners. The API serves those archives from `/desktop/downloads` and answers the desktop updater from `/desktop/releases`, so neither the website nor the application needs to know where the builds are hosted.
- 6334297: Move the shipped render implementations into their packages and replace the placeholder interfaces.

  Host seams added so render modules stay portable:

  - `component-ui` exposes `LinkProvider`, `Link`, and `NavLink`; hosts pass resolved hrefs and supply
    their own router.
  - `library-surface` defines `SurfaceAnalytics`, and `library-react` exposes `AnalyticsProvider` and
    `useAnalytics`, so render modules report events without knowing the provider.
  - `component-content` exposes `CustomResponseViewProvider`, so tool responses that need host data
    are registered by the application and unknown names fall back to the raw JSON view.

  Render ownership:

  - `component-ui`: page shell frame and header registry, page primitives, empty and sign-in states,
    loading spinner, page skeletons, and the file uploader presentation.
  - `component-models`: the provider icon registry and `ProviderGlyph`, Artificial Analysis panel,
    model options and lists, auto-router picker, hover preview, and the controlled selector trigger
    and panel.
  - `component-navigation`: sidebar parts, settings popover, theme and more-options menus,
    conversation list and controls, storage notice, and the search dialog.
  - `component-capabilities`: capability and app cards, experience grid, capability theme helpers,
    dynamic tool form, tool configuration dialog, tool result card, and the recipe card and dialogs.
  - `component-content`: generated response views, artefact classification, actions, callout, inline
    preview, document editor, and the sandboxed artefact renderers.
  - `component-conversation`: message content, actions, tool and function messages, citations,
    reasoning, search grounding, connector approval, agent trace, composer input and menus, council
    controls, keyboard shortcuts, and the welcome screen.
  - `component-account`: account sidebar shell, agent, team, connector, and provider views, the user
    settings form, and the provider and connector credential modals.
  - `component-workspaces`: workspace and project cards, member, invitation, governance, knowledge,
    coding environment, and activity views, Work sidebar navigation, and the create/invite dialogs.
  - `component-experiences`: article, note, and podcast presentation under `/content`; canvas and
    drawing under `/media`; the Strudel player under `/music` with the runtime as an optional peer;
    training panels and forms under `/training`.

  Shared behaviour moved below the render layer:

  - `schemas`: chat modes, model selection, region variants, provider display, token formatting,
    auto-router modes, reasoning helpers, recipe presentation, article report contracts, connector
    approval parsing, and model tool configuration parsing.
  - `library-chat`: the conversation message contract plus message, artefact, agent-trace, opinion,
    branching, compaction, speech, composer-command, and tool-result helpers, each on its own subpath.
  - `utility-core` gains `generateId`, `formatBytes`, and `getErrorMessage`; `utility-react` gains
    `useFileUpload` and `containsEventTarget`.

### Patch Changes

- 34728e1: Establish the reusable React frontend package graph, host controls, shared contracts, runtime
  libraries, render modules, tooling presets, and publishable package interfaces.
