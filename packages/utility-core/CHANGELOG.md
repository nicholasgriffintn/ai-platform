## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ed38a63: Wind down is no longer the same session every night.

  - **Tonight's pick.** Opening Wind down suggests one session from your day, last night's sleep and what you played recently, ready to start in one tap. It never suggests the same kind or sound two nights running.
  - **About your day.** Unwind names a few real things from today and sets them down. Turn off Mention my day when others can hear. Apple TV always leaves your day out.
  - **New kinds.** A slow story where nothing much happens, carried on over up to five nights; your Readwise highlights read back slowly; Park tomorrow, where what's on your mind comes back as things worth doing in the next edition; and Just the sound, with no voice at all. Sessions can now run to 30 minutes.
  - **Tonight's story in Worth a look.** Evening editions can offer a story on a topic you follow. It's only recorded when you tap it.
  - **Sound and voice.** One slider moves between the sound and the voice, and Sound after keeps the sound going for 15, 30 or 60 minutes after the voice ends. Pick the sound yourself (night, rain, sea, embers or aurora) or leave it to Poly. Sounds now crossfade as they loop and fade in and out when you play or pause.
  - **Animated scenes.** Each sound has its own slow scene, with tonight's real moon, on the web, iPhone and Apple TV.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 6db0566: Discover's Reading links stay recent and local, and the evening edition keeps the morning's media.

  - **Reading is news only.** Topics with no news today no longer fill up with encyclopaedia pages, band homepages or streaming links. Discover looks back a week before giving up, and leaves out anything older than that or without a date.
  - **A short list of top reads.** Reading holds up to six links, at most two per topic, newest first, with the same story only once even when it turns up on another site or with tracking on the link.
  - **Nothing you've already opened.** Pages from your browser shape what Discover looks for but never appear as reads, and the evening edition doesn't repeat the morning's links.
  - **Closer to home.** Searches use your country and English, picked up the next time you save Discover settings.
  - **Evening keeps the morning.** Today's episode, The Perch and Your week carry over to the evening edition instead of showing as not made yet.
  - **No more "a year ago" cards.** From before now brings back flashcards you missed and links you saved, and never resurfaces archived chats.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 187afde: Discover gathers before it writes, and Poly reads your own services without asking.

  - **A Discover notebook.** Before each morning Poly reads your connected services and researches every topic you follow into a notebook called Discover: one document per service and a dated research document per topic. The morning edition is written from those documents, so a slow or broken service never stops the edition. Open the notebook to see what Discover knows.
  - **Every connected service counts.** Discover now picks from the whole connector catalogue by what you have connected: Last.fm, Readwise, Hardcover, Audiobookshelf, Trakt, Marquee, YouTube, Raindrop, DEV, Oura, Google Calendar or Outlook, Gmail or Outlook newsletters, Google Tasks, Todoist or TickTick, Linear, GitHub, Fathom, WakaTime, OpenWeather, Google Photos, NASA and Artificial Analysis. Where two services cover the same thing, the first connected one is used. Each service shows when it was last read, or why it could not be, in Discover settings, where you can also set where you are for weather.
  - **Marquee.** Connect [Marquee](https://marquee.pashi.app) with an API token under Plugins. Poly can read your shelf, what is on tonight and the week ahead, search the catalogue, and, with your approval, save to your shelf or follow a name.
  - **No more approvals for reading your own accounts.** Poly, in your personal space, reads your connected accounts without a separate grant or an approval. Scheduled runs never create approvals; an operation that would need one is left out with a note instead of stalling the run.
  - **Last.fm and Trakt remember who you are.** Both connectors now take your username alongside the key, so Discover and Poly no longer have to ask.
  - **Interests are researched overnight.** Discover works out three to five interests from what you have been doing, favouring what you do outside Polychat over chats about it, and researches each one before the morning, so every interest has fresh reading on day one.
  - **More kinds of card.** Episodes airing, releases and gigs appear under Coming up; videos and podcast episodes under Watching and listening; newsletters worth a minute under Reading with the sender named. Each opens a chat with the right first step, such as adding an event to your calendar.
  - **An evening edition.** Turn it on in Discover settings for a second, shorter edition at 19:00 that looks at tomorrow. It never makes an episode or a Perch.
  - **Poly knows your week.** Poly's own thread and its daily look around read what Discover gathered, so Poly can be specific about what you have been listening to, reading and watching without re-reading your services.
  - **File things in a notebook from anywhere.** Ask Poly to put a page, a note or some files in a notebook by name, and it will, creating the notebook only when you ask.
  - **Send Studio work on.** A finished report, deck or table in a notebook's Studio has a Send menu for Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets and DEV when they are connected. Each send runs through the notebook chat and asks before it writes.
  - **Marquee records what you watch.** Tell Poly what you watched, are watching or want to see, with a rating and your thoughts, and it saves that to your Marquee shelf after you approve. Connectors without live discovery, such as Marquee, Last.fm and Trakt, now tell Poly their operations and fields instead of failing.
  - **A real feed.** Discover now reads the day's headlines for where you are and, when Reddit is connected, the best posts from your communities. Every interest is researched from the news of the last three days, with the publisher and date kept. Poly's picks lead the edition, and up to three stories per interest and from Reddit fill the Reading section beneath them, never repeating a link you have already seen. Your recent chats only shape the edition when nothing else is known about you yet.
  - **Discover reads the articles, not just the headlines.** Each page the overnight research finds is read in full and filed in the Discover notebook, and the edition is written from what the pages actually say, in plain prose rather than page markup. Opening a read card talks to the filed article, so Poly can give you the gist or the other side without fetching anything, and cards show the site's icon. Newsletters and Reddit posts carry their text too, so a card can tell you what happened rather than that something did.
  - **The Perch and Your week talk about the things, not about their notes.** The round-up now has the full text of the articles behind the day's reading and spends its time on what they report; Your week is built from what your documents, notebooks and chats actually contain, so it can say what you worked out rather than what it was not told.
  - **Episodes finish.** Chapters are now written and voiced one after another instead of all at once, so a later chapter no longer loses its save to an earlier one and sits on Queued. Your week shows its cover on the shelf and sits beside The Perch.
  - **Episode chapters say what they are about.** The chapter list shows what each chapter covers rather than the illustrator's notes, and Your week leaves out generated files it cannot describe.
  - **An edition is never lost to one bad link.** A page the feed cannot show as a card, such as a plain http address, is left out rather than making the whole edition unreadable, and an edition is checked before it is saved so a problem names the exact card.
  - **Failures say why.** A service that answers with an error, including a rate limit, is recorded as a failed read with the reason, and a connector that cannot be reached says what went wrong.
  - **Discover documents explain themselves.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook now reads as a page: when it was read and what was found. A service that could not be read says why. YouTube is read as your subscriptions and recent likes rather than your own uploads.
  - **Fixes.** The first edition after enabling Discover now gathers from your services before it is written, instead of being composed from recent chat titles alone. The Perch's captions follow the audio instead of jumping to the end, and loading a skill with a leading slash in its path no longer fails.

- d2905a6: Discover on the iPhone now does what it does on the web.

  - **Episodes pick up where you left off, on any device.** Where you stopped in an episode is saved to your account, so the web and the phone both resume there. Watching on the phone now counts towards tomorrow's episode being made ahead of time.
  - **Playback keeps going when you close the player.** The Perch, episodes, Your week and Wind down keep playing while you read other cards. A bar at the bottom of Home shows what is playing, with play, pause and stop.
  - **Ask about a card without leaving Home.** Asking Poly about a card opens the chat over Home, grounded in the article Discover already read, or the edition when there is no article.
  - **Save and follow from the phone.** Save a card to keep its edition past the two-week tidy, and follow a topic from its card.
  - **Earlier editions.** Home lists the last fortnight of editions, morning and evening, so yesterday's reading and this morning's edition are a tap away after the evening one arrives.
  - **What Poly is up to.** Home shows what needs you, what Poly is working on and what it has noted, and links from widgets and the Apple TV open the Perch, an episode or a card directly.
  - **Usage.** Notebook guides, Studio drafts and podcast scripts now count towards your usage like every other model call.
  - **Narration timing.** Video overviews and episodes time their pictures to the measured length of each narrated scene, so pictures change with the voice rather than drifting.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b2929f: Confirm your date of birth before your first message.

  - **Asked once, at the right moment.** The first time you send a message, signed in or not, on the web, desktop or iPhone, Polychat asks for your date of birth. It keeps only whether you meet the minimum age of 18, never the date, and the answer can't be changed later.
  - **Skip if you're just looking.** Skip the question and you can keep browsing, but you can't send messages until you answer it. Polychat asks again the next time you try to send one.
  - **Why we ask.** A new page at `/age-check` explains why we ask, what we keep and your rights in the UK and EU. The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy now say plainly that Polychat is for people aged 18 or over.
  - **Same rule on the API.** Creating a response, sending input to one and calling chat completions all return 403 until the age check is done, for API keys and anonymous sessions alike. Read or record it with `GET` and `POST /auth/age`.
  - **Self-hosting.** Set `AGE_GATE_ENABLED` to `false` in your Worker vars to turn the check off completely.

- 7accf45: Pull typed values out of text and images with Cloudflare's Clairic.

  - **Extraction models.** Clairic joins the catalogue as the first extraction model. Give it some text, or up to four images, and a list of named fields, and it returns each one as the type you asked for: a span of the text, a number, a date, a duration, a list, or an estimate or forecast with an 80% range. Anything the input does not say comes back empty with a best guess, never made up.
  - **`POST /extractions`.** Send `state`, `fields` and optional `images` and `reference_date`. Every scalar answer carries `confidence` and `p_null`, so you can decide in code which values to trust.
  - **Extract values tool.** Chat, Poly and automations can call `extract_values` to read order numbers, totals and dates from an email or invoice in one fast call, then hand the values to `decide`.
  - **Paperwork.** A new app for receipts, invoices and damage claims. Drop in photos or paste text, and each figure comes back with a confidence, the source highlighted where it was found, a running total and a CSV export.

- bf39c94: Poly can now make slide decks and spreadsheets, not just documents. Ask for a deck or a sheet and it lands in Files, where you can flip through the slides, switch between tables, revise it in conversation and download it as Markdown or CSV. Spreadsheet downloads are safe to open, since text that looks like a formula is kept as text.

  Research now checks your own Sources and synced accounts alongside the web, and shows what it found from them beside the report. Your passages stay with Polychat and are never sent to the research provider.

- 1fe4222: Discover gathers before it writes, and Poly reads your own services without asking.

  - **A Discover notebook.** Before each morning Poly reads your connected services and researches every topic you follow into a notebook called Discover: one document per service and a dated research document per topic. The morning edition is written from those documents, so a slow or broken service never stops the edition. Open the notebook to see what Discover knows.
  - **Every connected service counts.** Discover now picks from the whole connector catalogue by what you have connected: Last.fm, Readwise, Hardcover, Audiobookshelf, Trakt, Marquee, YouTube, Raindrop, DEV, Oura, Google Calendar or Outlook, Gmail or Outlook newsletters, Google Tasks, Todoist or TickTick, Linear, GitHub, Fathom, WakaTime, OpenWeather, Google Photos, NASA and Artificial Analysis. Where two services cover the same thing, the first connected one is used. Each service shows when it was last read, or why it could not be, in Discover settings, where you can also set where you are for weather.
  - **Marquee.** Connect [Marquee](https://marquee.pashi.app) with an API token under Plugins. Poly can read your shelf, what is on tonight and the week ahead, search the catalogue, and, with your approval, save to your shelf or follow a name.
  - **No more approvals for reading your own accounts.** Poly, in your personal space, reads your connected accounts without a separate grant or an approval. Scheduled runs never create approvals; an operation that would need one is left out with a note instead of stalling the run.
  - **Last.fm and Trakt remember who you are.** Both connectors now take your username alongside the key, so Discover and Poly no longer have to ask.
  - **Interests are researched overnight.** Discover works out three to five interests from what you have been doing, favouring what you do outside Polychat over chats about it, and researches each one before the morning, so every interest has fresh reading on day one.
  - **More kinds of card.** Episodes airing, releases and gigs appear under Coming up; videos and podcast episodes under Watching and listening; newsletters worth a minute under Reading with the sender named. Each opens a chat with the right first step, such as adding an event to your calendar.
  - **An evening edition.** Turn it on in Discover settings for a second, shorter edition at 19:00 that looks at tomorrow. It never makes an episode or a Perch.
  - **Poly knows your week.** Poly's own thread and its daily look around read what Discover gathered, so Poly can be specific about what you have been listening to, reading and watching without re-reading your services.
  - **File things in a notebook from anywhere.** Ask Poly to put a page, a note or some files in a notebook by name, and it will, creating the notebook only when you ask.
  - **Send Studio work on.** A finished report, deck or table in a notebook's Studio has a Send menu for Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets and DEV when they are connected. Each send runs through the notebook chat and asks before it writes.
  - **Marquee records what you watch.** Tell Poly what you watched, are watching or want to see, with a rating and your thoughts, and it saves that to your Marquee shelf after you approve. Connectors without live discovery, such as Marquee, Last.fm and Trakt, now tell Poly their operations and fields instead of failing.
  - **A real feed.** Discover now reads the day's headlines for where you are, the front page of Hacker News, and, when Reddit is connected, the best posts from your communities. Every interest is researched from the news of the last three days, with the publisher and date kept. Poly's picks lead the edition, and up to three stories per interest, Reddit and Hacker News fill the Reading section beneath them, never repeating a link you have already seen. Your recent chats only shape the edition when nothing else is known about you yet.
  - **Discover documents explain themselves.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook now reads as a page: when it was read, what was found, and the raw result underneath. A service that could not be read says why. YouTube is read as your subscriptions and recent likes rather than your own uploads.
  - **Fixes.** The first edition after enabling Discover now gathers from your services before it is written, instead of being composed from recent chat titles alone. The Perch's captions follow the audio instead of jumping to the end, and loading a skill with a leading slash in its path no longer fails.

- 06c02dd: Discover is your morning edition from Poly. Open Discover in the Chat sidebar, turn it on, and each morning Poly leaves a brief, painted topic tiles, reading, automations worth setting up and the odd check-in, built from what you've been talking about.

  - Pick any card to open it beside the feed with its own conversation, then tell Discover more, less or never. Follow a topic and it gets a notebook that collects each day's best links.
  - The Perch is a short two-host round-up of each edition, in your podcast show and its private feed.
  - Today's episode is a narrated, illustrated part of a five-day season on your top topic, with chapters, camera moves and a listen-only mode. Save a season as one long listen for your podcast app.
  - Wind down makes a five, ten or twenty minute breathing, body-scan or unwind session for the evening. It starts speaking within seconds, over quiet music made for the session that you can turn off.
  - Today's episode, The Perch and Wind down share one player beside the feed, and keep playing while you read other cards.
  - Connect Readwise, Last.fm, Trakt, Hardcover or Podcast Index, and Discover reads what you're reading, listening to and watching. Notebooks can now keep connected sources up to date.
  - From before cards bring back flashcards you missed, links you saved a while ago and what you were doing a year ago.
  - On Sundays, Your week is a short private recap of what you made, learned and finished.
  - Turn on Tell me when it's ready and Poly lets you know on your phone and connected channels when the edition lands.
  - Settings lists your connected services, each with its own switch for Discover. Oura and Audiobookshelf can now be connected too, and on iPhone Discover can use yesterday's Apple Health summary for the brief.
  - Health, sexuality, religion, politics and money only appear when you follow them or ask. Episodes and their quizzes and flashcards land in a followed topic's notebook, and episodes open in Files with the same player.
  - Audio and video across chat, Files and notebooks now use one player.
  - The product tour now lives at /tour. On iOS, Discover is in the menu and there is a Today widget.
  - Long structured generations no longer give up after 100 seconds, so episodes and other background work finish instead of failing part way.
  - Podcasts and episodes now show their real length and jump to the right place when you scrub or resume.
  - Background work interrupted part way, by a deploy or a crash, now picks up again instead of sitting unfinished.

- f4841cd: Files is now one library instead of tabs inside tabs. Everything you have given Polychat, everything it made and everything it remembers sits in a single grid or list, with All, Made, Sources and Memory as quick filters.

  - Make something new from the top of Files in one click: upload, write a note, start a memory, create a folder, make a podcast episode, or open Image studio and Replicate.
  - Drop files anywhere on Files, or on a folder, to add them.
  - Every item has a menu for opening its file, copying a share link, renaming, adding it to a folder and deleting it. Results Polychat made can now be renamed and deleted too.
  - Collections are now folders, shown above your files. A podcast show is a folder with its RSS feed controls on the folder page.
  - Search filters by name as you type, and a type filter, sort order and grid or list view sit beside it. In a project, search can also look inside files.
  - Memories open on their own page, every save is a revision, and you can name them in plain words.

- 8b965f6: Conversation groups are now notebooks. Click a notebook's name in the sidebar to open it: your sources on the left, the chat in the middle and Studio on the right. Every chat in a notebook answers from the sources you tick, names the source behind each claim, and can search the notebook's earlier chats too.

  - Add sources from Files, uploads, web pages or pasted text, or search the web from the notebook. Fast research finds pages to pick from; deep research writes a report in the background and brings back the pages it cites.
  - Studio makes audio overviews, slide decks, video overviews, mind maps, reports, flashcards, quizzes, infographics and data tables from the ticked sources. The pencil on each tile lets you choose the format, length, style, language and focus.
  - Flashcards and quizzes remember how you got on. Click any topic in a mind map to ask about it.
  - Save any reply as a note, and turn a note into a source when you want chats to read it.
  - Configure a notebook to answer as a learning guide or a persona of your own, at the length you like, from its sources only or with the web as well.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 82c133e: Eval suites can run as a provider batch on OpenAI and Anthropic routes, at about half the price, with results within 24 hours. A new `batch` provider category wraps the OpenAI Batch API and Anthropic Message Batches.
- 393652d: Image generation takes a `seed`, picks one when none is given, and reports it with the result, so the model can reuse it when the person asks to tweak an image and keep the composition.
- 7bec25b: Add Polychat Benchmarks: GeoGuess, Countdown, Fermi Bets, Long Odds, Hamster Wheel and Strudel Groove, run on one engine for official, personal and workspace scopes. Results at `/benchmarks` show intervals, Artificial Analysis indexes with attribution, measured cost and a medal table, people can play the auto-scored benchmarks and vote on blind pairs, the Benchmarks app runs them against your own models and keys, and the model selector previews each model's standings.
- c965c69: Sites can borrow colours and fonts from a public reference page. The computer sandbox reads the page's computed background, text, accent colours and font families, and the theme gains an optional custom palette and Google Fonts families that render over the named presets.
- 06e4619: Add two deterministic graders for summaries: `fact_coverage` scores the share of required facts (one per line in the case's expected value) an answer keeps, and `grounded_numbers` scores the share of the answer's numbers that appear in the case input.
- e41549c: Keep transcription timings. Providers return segments and words, `/audio/transcribe?timestamps=true` includes them, notes from media quote real `[m:ss]` markers instead of guessing, and recordings play captions and download them as SRT or VTT.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 6967a07: Host agent harnesses on Polychat's own ports. The agent worker now runs the Pi and OpenCode harnesses and a Hermes container behind one RPC contract, with models served by the API's OpenAI-compatible `/agents/model` port, workspace tools gated by the permission mode, and every reply streamed into chat as it is generated. OpenAI Agents joins as a remote harness through the same `agent-harness` chat provider. The sandbox worker moves to Sandbox SDK 1.0 with app-owned `Workspace` and `Computer` classes, absorbs the computer worker, and keeps caches and browser profiles with `DirectoryBackup`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 297b848: Expose dependency-neutral safe JSON parsing for reuse across Workers and server utilities.
- 462cbe7: Let the model search earlier conversations. `search_conversations` returns one excerpt per matching conversation with its title and date, scoped to the user's personal chats or, inside a project, to that project after an access check. It is on by default for signed-in chats. The unused, unescaped `MessageRepository.searchMessages` is replaced by the scoped query, and `excerptAround` joins the shared string helpers.
- c126d04: Add model governance to Work. Workspaces can search Hugging Face, import models and datasets pinned to a commit, and review static inspection evidence that never loads the weights. Approvals follow versioned policies with dry runs, exceptions and expiry. Suites can be compared across serving routes with confidence intervals, and fine-tunes run on Hugging Face Jobs from governed conversation snapshots with lineage and a compute record. Approved versions can be served on dedicated Inference Endpoints, drift is caught by nightly replays, and any route or version exports as a CycloneDX ML-BOM. Workspaces can enforce approved routes in project chats, and generations carry route and version tags. Each workspace connects its own Hugging Face account or organisation under Govern, with the platform token as an optional default, and retiring a deployed route deletes its endpoint. Training moves from Profile to Models › Build, and Hub staging for Bedrock imports is keyed by commit.
- 90f7110: Turn Work › Models into a model platform on the workspace's own provider accounts. Connect Hugging Face, AWS, Together, Fireworks, Nebius, Google Vertex, Azure AI Foundry, RunPod, Cloudflare Workers AI or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, then upload weights or register them from a bucket, build governed datasets from files, the Hub, buckets, rated conversations or a teacher model, and train with supervised, preference, reinforcement, distillation, embedding, merge or quantise runs after comparing trainers on fit and cost. Deployments are sized and priced per host, serve through aliases with eval gates, canaries and rollback, and appear in chat as models. Governance adds per-action permissions with separation of duties, budgets with spend approval, idle pause, revocation across lineage, erasure requests, an audit trail and CycloneDX, SPDX, model card and training content exports.

  The personal Training app, the training Worker and `component-experiences/training` are removed, and the API now mounts the platform under `/model-platform`.

- 1df361b: Remove unused public exports and dead helpers, consolidate duplicated duration, identifier, status, model-grouping, JSON, SMS and timing-safe comparison logic into shared modules, narrow the desktop backend option types to the interfaces each runner uses, and surface previously silent validation and rewrite failures in the UI.
- 57f8a16: Add Sites, a generative site builder that works from one brief. Jev classifies the brief into a plan (kind, scope, tone, palette, model tier), a tier-selected coding model streams the site as JSON Patch lines against a guardrailed component catalogue, and the shell renders every patch the moment it lands. `library-sites` holds the catalogue, patch stream compiler, validator and repair, prompt assembly, theme tokens and a deterministic Next.js and Tailwind code generator; `component-sites` holds the live React registry, themed preview and code view. Sites persist as revisioned outputs, refine in follow-ups, export as runnable project files, and hand off to a project's sandbox for a full build. The SSE buffer parser now lives once in `utility-core`. Sites are interactive (state, bindings, visibility, repeat, filters and actions in both the live renderer and the generated code), editable in place through an element inspector with zero-token edits and scoped refinement, exportable straight to a pull request with generated images, embeddable in chat through the `build_site` tool, revisioned with restore and public preview links, and judged by Jev at planning, refinement, quality-scoring and prompt-evaluation time.

### Patch Changes

- 4968623: Add the sandbox primitives. `library-sandbox` collects the mechanisms the API, sandbox Worker and computer Worker each carried: the dynamic Worker evaluation template and content-addressed code ids, outbound policy with a virtual tools origin, lease fences, HMAC-signed grants, execution control with pause and cancel, output redaction and request helpers. `ai-sandbox` composes them over Cloudflare's Worker Loader into `createEvaluator`, the loopback `OutboundGateway` entrypoint and `createCodeMode`. The API gains the `run_code` tool (backed by the `LOADER` binding) that runs model-written JavaScript in a fresh isolate and routes `tools.<name>(args)` calls back through the function registry. The computer Worker now fences leases and signs screen grants through the library and reports stale leases by code; the sandbox Worker uses the shared execution control, cancellation and redaction, and verifies JWTs with `@ngriffin_uk/auth-jwt` instead of a hand-rolled HS256 check.
- b105d00: Paginate flagged dataset rows correctly and preserve remaining warnings when excluding rows. Recalculate revision statistics, reject invalid indexes, reuse repeated exclusions, and recover partial saves without duplicating files.

  Preserve selections after failed actions, open the resulting revision after success, and show dataset loading errors. Fail missing upload previews promptly and cancel source streams when previews stop early.

  Associate switch labels and descriptions automatically when no explicit control ID is supplied.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 42c36ea: Release the applications from changesets. Merging a changeset that names an application versions it, tags it and publishes a GitHub release with its changelog entry; the desktop release also carries macOS, Windows and Linux archives built on their own runners. The API serves those archives from `/desktop/downloads` and answers the desktop updater from `/desktop/releases`, so neither the website nor the application needs to know where the builds are hosted.
- 6334297: Move the shipped render implementations into their packages and replace the placeholder interfaces.

  Host seams added so render modules stay portable:

  - `component-ui` exposes `LinkProvider`, `Link`, and `NavLink`; hosts pass resolved hrefs and supply
    their own router.
  - `library-surface` defines `SurfaceAnalytics`, and `library-react` exposes `AnalyticsProvider` and
    `useAnalytics`, so render modules report events without knowing the provider.
  - `component-content` exposes `CustomResponseViewProvider`, so tool responses that need host data
    are registered by the application and unknown names fall back to the raw JSON view.

  Render ownership:

  - `component-ui`: page shell frame and header registry, page primitives, empty and sign-in states,
    loading spinner, page skeletons, and the file uploader presentation.
  - `component-models`: the provider icon registry and `ProviderGlyph`, Artificial Analysis panel,
    model options and lists, auto-router picker, hover preview, and the controlled selector trigger
    and panel.
  - `component-navigation`: sidebar parts, settings popover, theme and more-options menus,
    conversation list and controls, storage notice, and the search dialog.
  - `component-capabilities`: capability and app cards, experience grid, capability theme helpers,
    dynamic tool form, tool configuration dialog, tool result card, and the recipe card and dialogs.
  - `component-content`: generated response views, artefact classification, actions, callout, inline
    preview, document editor, and the sandboxed artefact renderers.
  - `component-conversation`: message content, actions, tool and function messages, citations,
    reasoning, search grounding, connector approval, agent trace, composer input and menus, council
    controls, keyboard shortcuts, and the welcome screen.
  - `component-account`: account sidebar shell, agent, team, connector, and provider views, the user
    settings form, and the provider and connector credential modals.
  - `component-workspaces`: workspace and project cards, member, invitation, governance, knowledge,
    coding environment, and activity views, Work sidebar navigation, and the create/invite dialogs.
  - `component-experiences`: article, note, and podcast presentation under `/content`; canvas and
    drawing under `/media`; the Strudel player under `/music` with the runtime as an optional peer;
    training panels and forms under `/training`.

  Shared behaviour moved below the render layer:

  - `schemas`: chat modes, model selection, region variants, provider display, token formatting,
    auto-router modes, reasoning helpers, recipe presentation, article report contracts, connector
    approval parsing, and model tool configuration parsing.
  - `library-chat`: the conversation message contract plus message, artefact, agent-trace, opinion,
    branching, compaction, speech, composer-command, and tool-result helpers, each on its own subpath.
  - `utility-core` gains `generateId`, `formatBytes`, and `getErrorMessage`; `utility-react` gains
    `useFileUpload` and `containsEventTarget`.

### Patch Changes

- 34728e1: Establish the reusable React frontend package graph, host controls, shared contracts, runtime
  libraries, render modules, tooling presets, and publishable package interfaces.
