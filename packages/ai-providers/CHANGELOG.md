## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- f9945b6: Connected services read properly again. Trakt history loads instead of being blocked, remote MCP servers such as Marquee connect from Polychat's servers, and Discover keeps using the location on your profile when the saved setting is blank, so weather and local headlines return. Discover also reads this week's top Reddit posts on the topics you follow and the day's top DEV articles. A service that answers in a shape Discover cannot read now shows an error rather than "Nothing new". Discover no longer reads NASA's picture of the day, because NASA's service currently returns a placeholder instead of the picture.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 00f22ad: Workers AI Flux is now a realtime transcription provider. It runs Deepgram Flux on Cloudflare, needs no API key, and detects when you have finished speaking, so you can pick it for Live voice and dictation without any setup.

  The model picker in Live now lists only live models from providers that are ready, including the transcription providers (Workers AI, GreenPT, Cartesia, Mistral and ElevenLabs), which were missing before. Leaving Live puts back the chat model you had before.

  Verbatim's live line now streams from realtime transcription and builds as you speak, instead of refreshing every second. Each phrase is still checked word by word by Clef Omni once you pause.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e0ca7c6: Long work is no longer thrown away by arbitrary limits.

  - **Runs finish.** Hosted agents (Pi, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenAI Agents, Bedrock) are no longer stopped after 15 or 60 minutes, and native agents on Polychat Desktop are no longer cut off after 10 minutes. Stopping a run still stops it.
  - **Slow providers and tools get to answer.** Model, OCR, guardrail and reranking requests no longer give up after 30–120 seconds, Composio actions after 20 seconds, Composio file transfers after 15 seconds, or MCP tool calls after 15 seconds. Connecting to an MCP server still times out, so a dead server cannot hold up a chat.
  - **Delegates hand back everything.** A delegate's final answer reaches the parent conversation in full instead of its first 2,000 characters, and delegation goals and progress messages are no longer capped.
  - **Longer messages from other agents.** A2A and MCP callers can send teammates messages over 8,000 characters, and hosted agents receive your whole message and the full instructions rather than their last 100,000 and 12,000 characters.
  - **Drafts are not rejected for being a little long.** Decks, tables, mind maps, flashcards, quizzes, video overviews, notebook guides and memory maintenance no longer fail when a title or line runs past a character limit. Web search answers and memory maintenance are no longer cut short by a fixed output limit.

- 187afde: When a provider says your credits have run out, Polychat stops sending it work and moves on to the next model you have access to. Chats and scheduled routines that use an automatic model tier carry on with the next model in that tier mid-run. Speech renders switch to your next-best voice and finish, rather than failing until the month resets.

  - A model you picked yourself is never swapped. If its provider is out of credit, the error is shown.
  - Episodes, podcasts, video overviews and wind downs restart on the new voice, so one recording never mixes two voices.
  - ElevenLabs, OpenRouter and DeepSeek balances are checked in the background. The provider comes back as soon as your credits reset or you top up.
  - Keys that can't read their own balance, such as an ElevenLabs key limited to text to speech, get another try 15 minutes later. A refused request costs no credits, and if it is still empty your audio carries on with the next voice.
  - Saving a new key for a provider clears its out-of-credits state straight away.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b965f6: Polychat now speaks in the best voice your account can reach. Read-aloud, the speech tool, podcasts and video overviews all pick the highest-rated speech model you have access to, ranked by the Artificial Analysis text-to-speech arena. Add an ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Mistral or Amazon Polly key and your audio upgrades on its own.

  - New speech models: ElevenLabs Eleven v4, v4 Turbo, v3, Multilingual v2 and Flash v2.5, Cartesia Sonic 3.6, Mistral Voxtral 3 TTS and Amazon Polly Generative.
  - Audio settings now separate the provider, the model and the voice. Leave the provider on Automatic, or pick one and choose a model and voice from its list.
  - Podcasts use distinct host and guest voices on every provider, and video overviews use a narrator voice.
  - Notebook guides, Studio outputs and podcast scripts now use the medium model tier on your keys rather than the cheapest background model.

- 7accf45: Pull typed values out of text and images with Cloudflare's Clairic.

  - **Extraction models.** Clairic joins the catalogue as the first extraction model. Give it some text, or up to four images, and a list of named fields, and it returns each one as the type you asked for: a span of the text, a number, a date, a duration, a list, or an estimate or forecast with an 80% range. Anything the input does not say comes back empty with a best guess, never made up.
  - **`POST /extractions`.** Send `state`, `fields` and optional `images` and `reference_date`. Every scalar answer carries `confidence` and `p_null`, so you can decide in code which values to trust.
  - **Extract values tool.** Chat, Poly and automations can call `extract_values` to read order numbers, totals and dates from an email or invoice in one fast call, then hand the values to `decide`.
  - **Paperwork.** A new app for receipts, invoices and damage claims. Drop in photos or paste text, and each figure comes back with a confidence, the source highlighted where it was found, a running total and a CSV export.

- 11381a9: Teammates are now people you message, not settings you edit.

  - **Teammate threads.** Opening a teammate opens its own conversation, which carries on between visits. The sidebar lists the teammates you are talking to and your groups, newest activity first, with anyone who needs you at the top. Those conversations no longer also appear in the chat list. The conversation uses the same workspace as any other chat, and its side panel sums up the teammate: what it is doing, its autonomy, and how many routines and connections it has, each a click from Working context.
  - **Groups.** Use "Add a teammate" on a teammate's page to put two to six teammates in one conversation. Use @name, or tap a name in the header, to choose who answers. Every reply shows which teammate wrote it, and messages teammates send back while they work collapse into one "Messages from…" line you can open.
  - **Reactions.** React to a reply from the smiley button, or long-press on iOS. 👍 and 👎 also tell the teammate how it did, and teammates react 👀 to your message when they pick it up instead of replying "On it". A reaction never approves anything.
  - **Receipts.** When a tool sends, books, pays, deletes or changes something, the conversation shows a short receipt such as "Created routine · Friday inbox tidy · every Friday at 09:00", with the full output one click away.
  - **Live with teammates.** Live now works in teammate and group conversations. Start it from the Live button and stop it from the same place; each spoken turn goes to the teammate with its tools, and anything it wants to do still waits for your approval.
  - **Slack and Telegram signals.** Connected channels react 👀 when a message is picked up, show a working status in Slack threads and swap to ⚠️ if the run fails. Choose "Also ✅ when it is done" or "No reactions" when you connect a channel.
  - **More teammates to hire.** New jobs for personal admin, productivity, sales and marketing, operations and engineering, including Inbox tidy, Trip watcher, Morning brief, Meeting prep, Bug reproduction and Expense manager. Each arrives with its own character and offers to set up its routine.
  - **Dry runs.** Run any set-up routine as a dry run. Anything that would send, write, spend or delete returns a draft instead, so you can check a routine before it goes live.
  - **Batch review.** When three or more approvals are waiting, tick the ones you want and approve them together. Each is still approved on its own, exactly as listed.

- 7accf45: Mistral speech now runs on Voxtral 3, with a hosted voice agent for Live.

  - **Transcription.** Mistral transcription uses Voxtral Mini Transcribe 3, and you can pick Voxtral Small Transcribe 3 in Settings for higher accuracy. It detects the spoken language rather than assuming English, and timed transcripts now label who said what.
  - **Custom vocabulary.** Add names, acronyms and jargon under Settings → Audio, one per line, and Mistral transcription, live transcription and the voice agent will listen out for them.
  - **Live transcription.** Mistral live transcription uses Voxtral Mini Transcribe Realtime 3. Notes labels each speaker as they talk, and Live conversations use Mistral's own end-of-turn detection, so a thoughtful pause no longer cuts you off.
  - **Mistral Voice Agent.** Pick Mistral Voice in Live for a hosted Voxtral 3 agent that listens, searches the web when it needs to and answers aloud. It uses your Mistral key or the platform one, and you can interrupt it mid-sentence.
  - **Speech.** Mistral speech uses Voxtral TTS 3 with its new preset voices in over 20 languages. The default is Mary (English, UK). Choose how expressive the delivery is under Settings → Audio.
  - **Your voices.** Save a voice from an MP3 or WAV recording under Settings → Audio and use it for speech. Only you can use your saved voices, and you need to confirm the voice is yours or you have permission. The API offers the same through `/audio/voices`, and `/audio/speech` accepts `expressiveness`.

### Patch Changes

- 06c02dd: Discover is your morning edition from Poly. Open Discover in the Chat sidebar, turn it on, and each morning Poly leaves a brief, painted topic tiles, reading, automations worth setting up and the odd check-in, built from what you've been talking about.

  - Pick any card to open it beside the feed with its own conversation, then tell Discover more, less or never. Follow a topic and it gets a notebook that collects each day's best links.
  - The Perch is a short two-host round-up of each edition, in your podcast show and its private feed.
  - Today's episode is a narrated, illustrated part of a five-day season on your top topic, with chapters, camera moves and a listen-only mode. Save a season as one long listen for your podcast app.
  - Wind down makes a five, ten or twenty minute breathing, body-scan or unwind session for the evening. It starts speaking within seconds, over quiet music made for the session that you can turn off.
  - Today's episode, The Perch and Wind down share one player beside the feed, and keep playing while you read other cards.
  - Connect Readwise, Last.fm, Trakt, Hardcover or Podcast Index, and Discover reads what you're reading, listening to and watching. Notebooks can now keep connected sources up to date.
  - From before cards bring back flashcards you missed, links you saved a while ago and what you were doing a year ago.
  - On Sundays, Your week is a short private recap of what you made, learned and finished.
  - Turn on Tell me when it's ready and Poly lets you know on your phone and connected channels when the edition lands.
  - Settings lists your connected services, each with its own switch for Discover. Oura and Audiobookshelf can now be connected too, and on iPhone Discover can use yesterday's Apple Health summary for the brief.
  - Health, sexuality, religion, politics and money only appear when you follow them or ask. Episodes and their quizzes and flashcards land in a followed topic's notebook, and episodes open in Files with the same player.
  - Audio and video across chat, Files and notebooks now use one player.
  - The product tour now lives at /tour. On iOS, Discover is in the menu and there is a Today widget.
  - Long structured generations no longer give up after 100 seconds, so episodes and other background work finish instead of failing part way.
  - Podcasts and episodes now show their real length and jump to the right place when you scrub or resume.
  - Background work interrupted part way, by a deploy or a crash, now picks up again instead of sitting unfinished.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 82c133e: Eval suites can run as a provider batch on OpenAI and Anthropic routes, at about half the price, with results within 24 hours. A new `batch` provider category wraps the OpenAI Batch API and Anthropic Message Batches.
- 393652d: Image generation takes a `seed`, picks one when none is given, and reports it with the result, so the model can reuse it when the person asks to tweak an image and keep the composition.
- e820856: MCP tool results keep their PNG, JPEG and WebP images for models that read images, and tool-result images reach every provider as real image input instead of serialised base64 text. MCP server settings offer Inspo as a one-click server for design references.
- 65fbf81: Add the newest live models. Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live runs transcription sessions (so Notes dictation can use Gemini) and Gemini 3.5 Live Translate runs translation sessions, both through the existing Live API token flow. GPT-Live 1 joins the OpenAI realtime models as a server-brokered WebRTC call with Responses delegation, so the browser never holds a project key.
- 65fbf81: Refresh the realtime providers and Note Taker. Notes dictation now runs on the shared live session with any ready transcription provider and commits OpenAI turns on silence. Gemini Live defaults to Gemini 3.8 Live, OpenAI transcription sends the `languages` field and drops the retired Whisper and GPT-4o models, translation sessions use the dedicated translations endpoints, and proxied transcription sessions settle billing on their measured audio instead of a flat reservation. The proxy audio cap now covers the full session length, Notes lists return excerpts with server-side search, metadata is only described once a note has enough text, and the unused video analysis options are gone.
- e41549c: Keep transcription timings. Providers return segments and words, `/audio/transcribe?timestamps=true` includes them, notes from media quote real `[m:ss]` markers instead of guessing, and recordings play captions and download them as SRT or VTT.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6967a07: Host agent harnesses on Polychat's own ports. The agent worker now runs the Pi and OpenCode harnesses and a Hermes container behind one RPC contract, with models served by the API's OpenAI-compatible `/agents/model` port, workspace tools gated by the permission mode, and every reply streamed into chat as it is generated. OpenAI Agents joins as a remote harness through the same `agent-harness` chat provider. The sandbox worker moves to Sandbox SDK 1.0 with app-owned `Workspace` and `Computer` classes, absorbs the computer worker, and keeps caches and browser profiles with `DirectoryBackup`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 33133cc: Centralise every authored prompt in a catalogue and a retrieval package. `library-prompts-catalogue` holds all prompt text and fragments as data with a validating schema, variables and conditionals; `ai-prompts` retrieves entries by id, task or variant, renders `{{variable}}` templates, and composes the chat, meta-assistant, sandbox, memory, document, agent, sandbox-worker, provider and panel prompts. Hardcoded prompts are removed from `ai-providers` (image styles and guardrail policies), `ai-functions` (task system prompts), `ai-agents`, `schemas` (council member prompts, teammate and platform teammate briefs) and the API and sandbox worker services, which now source their text from the catalogue.
- ece96c4: Add the provider primitives package and move every provider implementation into it. `ProviderLibrary` owns categorised bootstrapping, alias and lifecycle resolution, per-category decorators, and host error mapping, and providers receive a `ProviderRuntime` (`ProviderHost` plus a resolver for sibling providers) instead of importing host modules. Platform credential detection, user-versus-platform API key resolution, and provider fallback move there from the API. `utility-server` holds the server helpers those providers share, and the API and sandbox Workers resolve providers through the library.
- c126d04: Add model governance to Work. Workspaces can search Hugging Face, import models and datasets pinned to a commit, and review static inspection evidence that never loads the weights. Approvals follow versioned policies with dry runs, exceptions and expiry. Suites can be compared across serving routes with confidence intervals, and fine-tunes run on Hugging Face Jobs from governed conversation snapshots with lineage and a compute record. Approved versions can be served on dedicated Inference Endpoints, drift is caught by nightly replays, and any route or version exports as a CycloneDX ML-BOM. Workspaces can enforce approved routes in project chats, and generations carry route and version tags. Each workspace connects its own Hugging Face account or organisation under Govern, with the platform token as an optional default, and retiring a deployed route deletes its endpoint. Training moves from Profile to Models › Build, and Hub staging for Bedrock imports is keyed by commit.

### Patch Changes

- 6db7a00: Add the experimentation primitives. `library-flags` is an OpenFeature-shaped evaluation contract with a rules provider (deterministic bucketing from the targeting key, weighted splits, targeting, enable gates), a Cloudflare Flagship binding adapter and a layered provider that lets the dashboard override code. `ai-experiments` defines flags and experiments in code, assigns users with `feature_flag.evaluation` exposure events, runs work under an assignment, tracks outcomes with assignments attached, and runs offline variant sweeps with metrics. The API wires a per-request `Experiments` into the service context, tags AI generation telemetry with `experiment.<key>` properties, gates the flagged cron tasks through flags whose defaults come from the existing environment toggles, accepts an optional `FLAGS` Flagship binding, and serves `GET /flags/bootstrap`. Cron `enabledWhen` may now be asynchronous.
