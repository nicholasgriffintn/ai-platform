# @ngriffin_uk/polychat-component-shell

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d3c809: Share one connected navigation shell between the web and desktop applications.

  `component-shell` is a new package holding the wiring layer that previously lived only in `apps/app`: the chat sidebar with its conversation list and menus, the product and conversation headers, the page and product shells, global search, the settings popover and the not-found page. It is the single exception to the router-, store- and client-free rule for `component-*` packages, because connecting the controlled presentation in `component-navigation` and `component-ui` to the stores and router is its whole job.

  What differs between hosts arrives through `ShellHostProvider`: the origin public share links point at, the dialogs a host owns alone, and the actions that open them. A host that has not migrated an action supplies one that throws, so a gap stays visible instead of becoming a control that quietly does nothing.

  `library-react` publishes `DISCOVER_PATH` alongside the existing place paths, and `library-client` publishes `WEB_APP_BASE_URL` so a host without a web origin can still build share links.

  `component-conversation` drops `ConversationHeader`. It was the desktop's stand-in for a real header and is replaced by the shared `ConversationProductHeader`.
