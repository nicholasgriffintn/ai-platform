### Minor Changes

- 8b965f6: Polychat now speaks in the best voice your account can reach. Read-aloud, the speech tool, podcasts and video overviews all pick the highest-rated speech model you have access to, ranked by the Artificial Analysis text-to-speech arena. Add an ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Mistral or Amazon Polly key and your audio upgrades on its own.

  - New speech models: ElevenLabs Eleven v4, v4 Turbo, v3, Multilingual v2 and Flash v2.5, Cartesia Sonic 3.6, Mistral Voxtral 3 TTS and Amazon Polly Generative.
  - Audio settings now separate the provider, the model and the voice. Leave the provider on Automatic, or pick one and choose a model and voice from its list.
  - Podcasts use distinct host and guest voices on every provider, and video overviews use a narrator voice.
  - Notebook guides, Studio outputs and podcast scripts now use the medium model tier on your keys rather than the cheapest background model.

- 91c7d3d: Choose what Polychat can reach for on its own.

  - **Capabilities settings.** A new Capabilities section in Customise Chat has switches for web search and for documents and connected apps. Turn one off and Polychat stops using it by itself, including deep research for web search. Tools you pick in the composer, or that a project, teammate or recipe sets up, still work.
  - **Chat history means chat history.** Searching your earlier chats now follows the chat history switch in Memories. Turn it on if you want Polychat to look back through your previous conversations.

- 6980de8: Teammates now check what they are about to do before doing it, and skills are scanned before they go live.

  - **Intent check on real effects.** Before a routine, channel reply, delegation or handoff sends a message, spends money, deletes something, handles a credential or exports data, a second check compares the call, where it lands and who started the run against what you asked for. A call that does not follow from the request, or reaches a recipient or system you never named, waits for your approval with the reason attached.
  - **Connector and MCP calls say what they do.** A connector operation or an MCP tool is classed from the flags its vendor publishes: a read-only tool runs as a read, a tool that deletes or overwrites is treated as destructive and always asks, and anything unflagged stays a write. Dry runs draft the destructive ones instead of running them.
  - **Skill scanning.** Promoting a draft skill or importing one from another scope scans it first. Instructions that try to override the assistant, hide text, act without telling you, move credentials or private data out, embed a secret or point at a private address keep the draft but block it from going live, with each problem named.

- 80fee8e: MCP tools can now show their own interface in a conversation, and Polychat can be used as a tool from other assistants.

  - **Apps inside the chat.** When a connected MCP integration ships an interface for a tool (the MCP Apps extension), Polychat renders it in the reply in a sandboxed frame: pickers, tables, small dashboards. The app can refresh its own data through read-only tools; anything that would change something still goes through the conversation so it can ask you first.
  - **Polychat as an MCP server.** Point Claude, ChatGPT, Codex or any MCP client at the /mcp endpoint with a Polychat API key and it can run the same tools you can run in Polychat, and ask any of your teammates to take on a job. Anything that needs approval waits for you in Polychat.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ece96c4: Add the AI function, agent, tool, workflow and task primitives. `ai-functions` exposes task-shaped calls (`generateText`, `generateObject`, `classify`, `extract`, media and retrieval) over a provider runtime. `ai-agents` builds `Agent` on the decision loop and tool catalogues, and replaces `agent-core` in every host. `library-tools` replaces `library-tool-runtime` and the tool registry schema with definitions, catalogues, validation and execution. `library-tasks` adds outcome settlement, execution leases, handler registries, polling and cron schedules and status machines, and `ai-workflows` wraps them in `on`/`poll`/`every` so the API declares queued tasks, self-rescheduling pollers (now with an attempt cap) and cron jobs in one registry.
- 67b52ed: Let people approve a Poly write once and for all, for one destination. When Poly at the assistant level waits on a write with a known destination, the approval card offers "Always allow here". The server derives the tool and destination from the stored pending call and keeps the approval on the Poly context for thirty days, where a Cedar condition lets matching writes run unattended. Sends, spending, deletes, credentials and exports still ask every time. Approvals are listed in Poly's autonomy menu and can be revoked there.
- 07290f2: Add a teammate autonomy dial. A teammate context can be an observer, an assistant or a partner, enforced by Cedar over each call's effect class: observers only read and draft, assistants ask before writes, partners write within their grants, and sends, spending, deletes, credentials and exports always ask. Poly starts as an assistant and its overlay can change the level. Run triggers now reach tool availability and execution, so Poly's navigation gate holds there too.
- cb9ddcc: Declare what each tool changes. `TOOL_EFFECT_CLASSES` names eight effect classes, `ToolDefinition.effects` declares a tool's class and destination, and `resolveToolEffectClass` treats an undeclared tool as a write. The API's built-in catalogue now refuses a tool without effects, and `call_api` and `use_recipe_connector` classify each call from its input.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d841b16: Extract shared tool runtime. `defineTool` gives every agent runtime one provider-facing tool shape, and the permission and mode-budget gating moves out of `apps/api` behind a narrowed `ToolAccessSubject`. `library-agent-core` keeps the control tool names and drops the definitions, staying a zero-dependency leaf.
- f440eb7: Shape every provider-facing tool schema through the shared tool runtime. `defineTool` accepts a complete generated schema, `toProviderToolDefinitions` owns the bedrock and anthropic envelopes, and `flattenObjectRootSchema` moves out of the API. The loop control tool names are declared once, in the agent core.
- 2c14529: Let a caller widen a turn's approval requirements beyond its mode's. Project task flow stages use this to make `requiresApprovalFor` real: a stage can demand a person's say-so for permissions the mode would have allowed unattended, and can never lower the mode's own bar.
