## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d70d5d: Everything you give Polychat is now read, filed and searched the same way, whichever door it came in by.

  - **See what Poly knows about a file.** Open any file and choose Knowledge to see where it came from, whether it is searchable yet, its summary and topics, which files it cites, repeats or was made from, and anything that failed with a button to read it again.
  - **Decide how each file is used.** Turn off Use in answers to keep a file without Poly or teammates quoting it, let followed pages remove themselves after a week, a month or three, and mark a file confidential so teammates never see it.
  - **Topics that file themselves.** New files are filed under topics and the people, places and projects they are about. Open a topic from a file's Knowledge panel to see everything filed under it.
  - **Follow a connected service, item by item.** In a project's Files, choose Follow, then A connected service, to follow a Notion database, Google Docs in Drive, a Gmail search, a Slack channel, GitHub issues, Linear issues or a Jira search. Each page, email, message or issue arrives as its own file, unchanged items are skipped, and anything removed upstream is archived.
  - **Search your knowledge bases too.** Connect Cloudflare AI Search or Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases in Plugins and Poly can search them alongside your files without copying them in. Project owners and admins can attach their connection to a project under Follow, How new files are read.
  - **Choose how new files are read.** Summaries, topics and related-file links can each be turned off for your library or a project under Follow, How new files are read.
  - **Finished work is findable.** Documents, decks and sheets Polychat made are searched alongside your sources, and search can be narrowed by kind, origin, topic, folder or date.
  - **Documents in global search.** Search now finds files in your library as well as chats and projects.
  - **Long files no longer slow anything down.** Very long files are kept in file storage and indexed in full, however long they are.
  - **Webhooks for knowledge.** Webhook endpoints can subscribe to files being filed, updated, removed or read through.

- 8f480ac: Memories are now always kept as documents you can read and edit, and Poly finds them the way it finds your files.

  - **One kind of memory.** Polychat's own memory keeps what it learns about you, and about each project, as documents under Files › Memory. The old one-line memories are gone, so Poly starts these documents fresh.
  - **Better recall.** Memories are searched by meaning and by exact words, and Poly gets back the passage that matters rather than a whole document.
  - **Quick notes, tidied later.** When a memory document is long or has just changed, new memories are added under Recently noted straight away and folded into the document a few minutes later.
  - **Your search index, your storage.** If you keep your search index in S3 Vectors or DynamoDB Vectors, it now holds your own files as well as your memories. Choose it under Settings › Knowledge.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 11dabe3: See how the news is framed before you trust it.

  - **How it's framed.** A Discover read has a How it's framed button. It shows the article's slant and tone, who it relies on, any loaded wording (quoted exactly as written) and what it leaves out, plus a writing grade. It is kept with the article, so opening it again costs nothing.
  - **Compare the coverage.** A Discover topic with two or more articles that day can compare them: what every outlet agrees on, each outlet's angle, where they differ and what none of them mention. The comparison is filed in your Discover notebook.
  - **Article analysis speaks the same language.** Article analysis in Apps now uses the same framing check, so its reports describe framing and omissions rather than labelling pieces left or right.
  - Both count towards your monthly Discover budget and stop when it is spent.

- ed38a63: Listen to what you read.

  - **Listen.** Discover reads and text, web page and document files have a Listen button that reads them aloud in your narrator voice. It starts playing as soon as the first passage is ready and carries on while the rest are recorded. Once read, it plays again without recording anew unless the text changes.
  - **Share.** On iPhone, a read in Discover has a Share button for sending it to another app.

- 48eb3dc: Everything Polychat gathers from outside now lands in one knowledge base, and you can follow feeds and topics yourself.

  - **Follow feeds and topics.** Use the Follow tile in Files, yours or a project's, or the Follow tab when adding sources to a notebook. Pick an RSS or Atom feed, a news topic or a web topic, and new pages arrive as sources on a schedule. Followed items sit in the same place with Read now, Pause and Stop following.
  - **Pages are filed once.** Discover, notebook research, followed topics and stored page extracts share one copy of each page per personal library or project, so the same article is no longer read, summarised and indexed again for every feature.
  - **Your feeds come first.** Discover and topic syncs check the feeds you follow before searching the web, and only widen the search when nothing fresh turns up.
  - **Notebook syncs show their documents.** Documents synced from a connection into a personal notebook are no longer hidden.

- ed38a63: Wind down is no longer the same session every night.

  - **Tonight's pick.** Opening Wind down suggests one session from your day, last night's sleep and what you played recently, ready to start in one tap. It never suggests the same kind or sound two nights running.
  - **About your day.** Unwind names a few real things from today and sets them down. Turn off Mention my day when others can hear. Apple TV always leaves your day out.
  - **New kinds.** A slow story where nothing much happens, carried on over up to five nights; your Readwise highlights read back slowly; Park tomorrow, where what's on your mind comes back as things worth doing in the next edition; and Just the sound, with no voice at all. Sessions can now run to 30 minutes.
  - **Tonight's story in Worth a look.** Evening editions can offer a story on a topic you follow. It's only recorded when you tap it.
  - **Sound and voice.** One slider moves between the sound and the voice, and Sound after keeps the sound going for 15, 30 or 60 minutes after the voice ends. Pick the sound yourself (night, rain, sea, embers or aurora) or leave it to Poly. Sounds now crossfade as they loop and fade in and out when you play or pause.
  - **Animated scenes.** Each sound has its own slow scene, with tonight's real moon, on the web, iPhone and Apple TV.

### Patch Changes

- ce66ee9: Discover keeps your conversations with its cards, and background work leans on better everyday models.

  - **Card conversations stay with the card.** Asking about a Discover card and coming back later now opens that conversation again, not an empty Take it further.
  - **Write again lives in Settings.** The page header is just Settings now. Write again sits under Today's edition in the Discover settings.
  - **Reading, titling and compaction prefer Workers AI.** GPT-6 Luna leads for accounts that can use OpenAI, Workers AI comes next, and Google models are now the last resort.

- Updated dependencies [ed38a63]
  - @ngriffin_uk/polychat-utility-core@0.7.0

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e69d886: Fewer needless approval prompts, and Discover chats that survive a reload.

  - **Reads and drafts no longer ask.** Reading a page you linked, saving a note or anything else that stays in your own space now just runs. The second check on whether a call matches what you asked is kept for calls that change shared state, send, spend or delete.
  - **Discover chats stay with their item.** Each item in For you or Reading keeps its own conversation, so reloading, switching items or opening it on your phone brings the chat back, and Poly sees the item you asked about rather than the whole edition.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6db0566]
  - @ngriffin_uk/polychat-utility-core@0.6.1

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 187afde: Discover gathers before it writes, and Poly reads your own services without asking.

  - **A Discover notebook.** Before each morning Poly reads your connected services and researches every topic you follow into a notebook called Discover: one document per service and a dated research document per topic. The morning edition is written from those documents, so a slow or broken service never stops the edition. Open the notebook to see what Discover knows.
  - **Every connected service counts.** Discover now picks from the whole connector catalogue by what you have connected: Last.fm, Readwise, Hardcover, Audiobookshelf, Trakt, Marquee, YouTube, Raindrop, DEV, Oura, Google Calendar or Outlook, Gmail or Outlook newsletters, Google Tasks, Todoist or TickTick, Linear, GitHub, Fathom, WakaTime, OpenWeather, Google Photos, NASA and Artificial Analysis. Where two services cover the same thing, the first connected one is used. Each service shows when it was last read, or why it could not be, in Discover settings, where you can also set where you are for weather.
  - **Marquee.** Connect [Marquee](https://marquee.pashi.app) with an API token under Plugins. Poly can read your shelf, what is on tonight and the week ahead, search the catalogue, and, with your approval, save to your shelf or follow a name.
  - **No more approvals for reading your own accounts.** Poly, in your personal space, reads your connected accounts without a separate grant or an approval. Scheduled runs never create approvals; an operation that would need one is left out with a note instead of stalling the run.
  - **Last.fm and Trakt remember who you are.** Both connectors now take your username alongside the key, so Discover and Poly no longer have to ask.
  - **Interests are researched overnight.** Discover works out three to five interests from what you have been doing, favouring what you do outside Polychat over chats about it, and researches each one before the morning, so every interest has fresh reading on day one.
  - **More kinds of card.** Episodes airing, releases and gigs appear under Coming up; videos and podcast episodes under Watching and listening; newsletters worth a minute under Reading with the sender named. Each opens a chat with the right first step, such as adding an event to your calendar.
  - **An evening edition.** Turn it on in Discover settings for a second, shorter edition at 19:00 that looks at tomorrow. It never makes an episode or a Perch.
  - **Poly knows your week.** Poly's own thread and its daily look around read what Discover gathered, so Poly can be specific about what you have been listening to, reading and watching without re-reading your services.
  - **File things in a notebook from anywhere.** Ask Poly to put a page, a note or some files in a notebook by name, and it will, creating the notebook only when you ask.
  - **Send Studio work on.** A finished report, deck or table in a notebook's Studio has a Send menu for Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets and DEV when they are connected. Each send runs through the notebook chat and asks before it writes.
  - **Marquee records what you watch.** Tell Poly what you watched, are watching or want to see, with a rating and your thoughts, and it saves that to your Marquee shelf after you approve. Connectors without live discovery, such as Marquee, Last.fm and Trakt, now tell Poly their operations and fields instead of failing.
  - **A real feed.** Discover now reads the day's headlines for where you are and, when Reddit is connected, the best posts from your communities. Every interest is researched from the news of the last three days, with the publisher and date kept. Poly's picks lead the edition, and up to three stories per interest and from Reddit fill the Reading section beneath them, never repeating a link you have already seen. Your recent chats only shape the edition when nothing else is known about you yet.
  - **Discover reads the articles, not just the headlines.** Each page the overnight research finds is read in full and filed in the Discover notebook, and the edition is written from what the pages actually say, in plain prose rather than page markup. Opening a read card talks to the filed article, so Poly can give you the gist or the other side without fetching anything, and cards show the site's icon. Newsletters and Reddit posts carry their text too, so a card can tell you what happened rather than that something did.
  - **The Perch and Your week talk about the things, not about their notes.** The round-up now has the full text of the articles behind the day's reading and spends its time on what they report; Your week is built from what your documents, notebooks and chats actually contain, so it can say what you worked out rather than what it was not told.
  - **Episodes finish.** Chapters are now written and voiced one after another instead of all at once, so a later chapter no longer loses its save to an earlier one and sits on Queued. Your week shows its cover on the shelf and sits beside The Perch.
  - **Episode chapters say what they are about.** The chapter list shows what each chapter covers rather than the illustrator's notes, and Your week leaves out generated files it cannot describe.
  - **An edition is never lost to one bad link.** A page the feed cannot show as a card, such as a plain http address, is left out rather than making the whole edition unreadable, and an edition is checked before it is saved so a problem names the exact card.
  - **Failures say why.** A service that answers with an error, including a rate limit, is recorded as a failed read with the reason, and a connector that cannot be reached says what went wrong.
  - **Discover documents explain themselves.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook now reads as a page: when it was read and what was found. A service that could not be read says why. YouTube is read as your subscriptions and recent likes rather than your own uploads.
  - **Fixes.** The first edition after enabling Discover now gathers from your services before it is written, instead of being composed from recent chat titles alone. The Perch's captions follow the audio instead of jumping to the end, and loading a skill with a leading slash in its path no longer fails.

- d2905a6: Discover on the iPhone now does what it does on the web.

  - **Episodes pick up where you left off, on any device.** Where you stopped in an episode is saved to your account, so the web and the phone both resume there. Watching on the phone now counts towards tomorrow's episode being made ahead of time.
  - **Playback keeps going when you close the player.** The Perch, episodes, Your week and Wind down keep playing while you read other cards. A bar at the bottom of Home shows what is playing, with play, pause and stop.
  - **Ask about a card without leaving Home.** Asking Poly about a card opens the chat over Home, grounded in the article Discover already read, or the edition when there is no article.
  - **Save and follow from the phone.** Save a card to keep its edition past the two-week tidy, and follow a topic from its card.
  - **Earlier editions.** Home lists the last fortnight of editions, morning and evening, so yesterday's reading and this morning's edition are a tap away after the evening one arrives.
  - **What Poly is up to.** Home shows what needs you, what Poly is working on and what it has noted, and links from widgets and the Apple TV open the Perch, an episode or a card directly.
  - **Usage.** Notebook guides, Studio drafts and podcast scripts now count towards your usage like every other model call.
  - **Narration timing.** Video overviews and episodes time their pictures to the measured length of each narrated scene, so pictures change with the voice rather than drifting.

- 0fe409a: Folders in Files can now hold things Polychat made, not just your files and notes. Use Add to folder on any result, episode or document.

  - Discover files its episodes into a Discover episodes folder, and its research and service notes into a Discover research folder. Episodes you already have go into the folder when it is first made.
  - Your week episodes get their own Your week podcast show, as The Perch already does.
  - The research note behind a podcast episode is filed in the same show as the episode.

- 0fe409a: The desktop app can share what you do on your Mac with Discover and Poly.

  - **Choose what to share.** Open Profile, then Mac activity, in the desktop app and switch on any of: browsing in Helium, Chrome, Brave, Arc, Edge, Vivaldi or Chromium; Claude Code and Codex sessions; time in the apps you use; and what Apple Music or Spotify played. Everything starts off.
  - **Summaries leave, files don't.** The Mac reads history and transcripts itself and sends summaries, never the files: short lines such as a site with your visit count and time spent, or a project with its session title and prompt count. Searches and window titles each have their own switch.
  - **Discover knows what you read and worked on.** With "Include the pages you read" on, the Mac also sends the pages you spent longest on, and Discover reads the public ones so the edition can say what they were about rather than only naming them. With "Include what each session was about" on, each Claude Code or Codex session carries your first and latest prompt and the agent's last reply.
  - **Pause from the menu bar.** The Poly menu says what's being shared and lets you pause for an hour, until tomorrow or until you resume. Anything you did while paused is never sent, even after you resume.
  - **See exactly what was sent.** The settings tab shows the last send line by line. Mark any site, app or project as never shared, or forget everything this Mac sent.
  - **Discover and Poly use it straight away.** Each source appears in the Discover notebook as a document for your Mac, so morning editions and Poly's sense of your week include it. Switch a Mac source off in Discover settings to stop using it there.

- e0ca7c6: Memories are kept as whole documents, and what Polychat gathers is summarised rather than pasted.

  - **One document per subject.** When Polychat remembers something with document memory, it files it into the memory document for that subject, or starts a new one, instead of adding a line to a single list. The whole document is rewritten each time: what to remember, why, and how it should shape future answers, with links to related memories. A newer fact replaces the one it contradicts.
  - **Memories say what they hold.** Each memory document has a one-line description and a kind: about you, how to work with you, ongoing work, or where to find things. Poly picks memories by those descriptions, and you can see them under File info.
  - **Summaries for gathered reading.** Pages Discover reads and the browsing your Mac shares are recorded with a summary of what each page says and its key points, rather than its opening lines. Discover keeps the whole page in its notebook. Documents also get a summary when they are added or change, so when a notebook is too big to read in full, guides, Studio and episodes get a summary of every source instead of only the first few.
  - **Service documents are easier to read.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook lists what was found without the raw response underneath.

- e0ca7c6: Long work is no longer thrown away by arbitrary limits.

  - **Runs finish.** Hosted agents (Pi, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenAI Agents, Bedrock) are no longer stopped after 15 or 60 minutes, and native agents on Polychat Desktop are no longer cut off after 10 minutes. Stopping a run still stops it.
  - **Slow providers and tools get to answer.** Model, OCR, guardrail and reranking requests no longer give up after 30–120 seconds, Composio actions after 20 seconds, Composio file transfers after 15 seconds, or MCP tool calls after 15 seconds. Connecting to an MCP server still times out, so a dead server cannot hold up a chat.
  - **Delegates hand back everything.** A delegate's final answer reaches the parent conversation in full instead of its first 2,000 characters, and delegation goals and progress messages are no longer capped.
  - **Longer messages from other agents.** A2A and MCP callers can send teammates messages over 8,000 characters, and hosted agents receive your whole message and the full instructions rather than their last 100,000 and 12,000 characters.
  - **Drafts are not rejected for being a little long.** Decks, tables, mind maps, flashcards, quizzes, video overviews, notebook guides and memory maintenance no longer fail when a title or line runs past a character limit. Web search answers and memory maintenance are no longer cut short by a fixed output limit.

  - @ngriffin_uk/polychat-utility-core@0.6.0

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b2929f: Confirm your date of birth before your first message.

  - **Asked once, at the right moment.** The first time you send a message, signed in or not, on the web, desktop or iPhone, Polychat asks for your date of birth. It keeps only whether you meet the minimum age of 18, never the date, and the answer can't be changed later.
  - **Skip if you're just looking.** Skip the question and you can keep browsing, but you can't send messages until you answer it. Polychat asks again the next time you try to send one.
  - **Why we ask.** A new page at `/age-check` explains why we ask, what we keep and your rights in the UK and EU. The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy now say plainly that Polychat is for people aged 18 or over.
  - **Same rule on the API.** Creating a response, sending input to one and calling chat completions all return 403 until the age check is done, for API keys and anonymous sessions alike. Read or record it with `GET` and `POST /auth/age`.
  - **Self-hosting.** Set `AGE_GATE_ENABLED` to `false` in your Worker vars to turn the check off completely.

- 8b965f6: Polychat now speaks in the best voice your account can reach. Read-aloud, the speech tool, podcasts and video overviews all pick the highest-rated speech model you have access to, ranked by the Artificial Analysis text-to-speech arena. Add an ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Mistral or Amazon Polly key and your audio upgrades on its own.

  - New speech models: ElevenLabs Eleven v4, v4 Turbo, v3, Multilingual v2 and Flash v2.5, Cartesia Sonic 3.6, Mistral Voxtral 3 TTS and Amazon Polly Generative.
  - Audio settings now separate the provider, the model and the voice. Leave the provider on Automatic, or pick one and choose a model and voice from its list.
  - Podcasts use distinct host and guest voices on every provider, and video overviews use a narrator voice.
  - Notebook guides, Studio outputs and podcast scripts now use the medium model tier on your keys rather than the cheapest background model.

- 91c7d3d: Choose what Polychat can reach for on its own.

  - **Capabilities settings.** A new Capabilities section in Customise Chat has switches for web search and for documents and connected apps. Turn one off and Polychat stops using it by itself, including deep research for web search. Tools you pick in the composer, or that a project, teammate or recipe sets up, still work.
  - **Chat history means chat history.** Searching your earlier chats now follows the chat history switch in Memories. Turn it on if you want Polychat to look back through your previous conversations.

- 7accf45: Pull typed values out of text and images with Cloudflare's Clairic.

  - **Extraction models.** Clairic joins the catalogue as the first extraction model. Give it some text, or up to four images, and a list of named fields, and it returns each one as the type you asked for: a span of the text, a number, a date, a duration, a list, or an estimate or forecast with an 80% range. Anything the input does not say comes back empty with a best guess, never made up.
  - **`POST /extractions`.** Send `state`, `fields` and optional `images` and `reference_date`. Every scalar answer carries `confidence` and `p_null`, so you can decide in code which values to trust.
  - **Extract values tool.** Chat, Poly and automations can call `extract_values` to read order numbers, totals and dates from an email or invoice in one fast call, then hand the values to `decide`.
  - **Paperwork.** A new app for receipts, invoices and damage claims. Drop in photos or paste text, and each figure comes back with a confidence, the source highlighted where it was found, a running total and a CSV export.

- 911642e: Clearer setup for plugins that connect with an API key.

  - **Callback URL.** The connect dialog shows a callback URL you can copy. If the provider asks for a callback or redirect URL when you create the key, paste this one in.
  - **One box per credential.** Plugins that need more than one value now ask for each separately. Podcast Index asks for its API key and API secret, and Audiobookshelf for its server address and API token, so there's no need to join them with a colon or bar yourself.

- bf39c94: Poly can now make slide decks and spreadsheets, not just documents. Ask for a deck or a sheet and it lands in Files, where you can flip through the slides, switch between tables, revise it in conversation and download it as Markdown or CSV. Spreadsheet downloads are safe to open, since text that looks like a formula is kept as text.

  Research now checks your own Sources and synced accounts alongside the web, and shows what it found from them beside the report. Your passages stay with Polychat and are never sent to the research provider.

- b3e3ea2: Poly can now work inside folders you grant on Polychat Desktop. Grant a folder in the desktop app and any chat or teammate can list, search, read and write files there with the new desktop tools, as long as the desktop is online. Reads happen without ceremony; writes go through the usual approval and autonomy rules, and nothing outside a granted folder is reachable.
- 1fe4222: Discover gathers before it writes, and Poly reads your own services without asking.

  - **A Discover notebook.** Before each morning Poly reads your connected services and researches every topic you follow into a notebook called Discover: one document per service and a dated research document per topic. The morning edition is written from those documents, so a slow or broken service never stops the edition. Open the notebook to see what Discover knows.
  - **Every connected service counts.** Discover now picks from the whole connector catalogue by what you have connected: Last.fm, Readwise, Hardcover, Audiobookshelf, Trakt, Marquee, YouTube, Raindrop, DEV, Oura, Google Calendar or Outlook, Gmail or Outlook newsletters, Google Tasks, Todoist or TickTick, Linear, GitHub, Fathom, WakaTime, OpenWeather, Google Photos, NASA and Artificial Analysis. Where two services cover the same thing, the first connected one is used. Each service shows when it was last read, or why it could not be, in Discover settings, where you can also set where you are for weather.
  - **Marquee.** Connect [Marquee](https://marquee.pashi.app) with an API token under Plugins. Poly can read your shelf, what is on tonight and the week ahead, search the catalogue, and, with your approval, save to your shelf or follow a name.
  - **No more approvals for reading your own accounts.** Poly, in your personal space, reads your connected accounts without a separate grant or an approval. Scheduled runs never create approvals; an operation that would need one is left out with a note instead of stalling the run.
  - **Last.fm and Trakt remember who you are.** Both connectors now take your username alongside the key, so Discover and Poly no longer have to ask.
  - **Interests are researched overnight.** Discover works out three to five interests from what you have been doing, favouring what you do outside Polychat over chats about it, and researches each one before the morning, so every interest has fresh reading on day one.
  - **More kinds of card.** Episodes airing, releases and gigs appear under Coming up; videos and podcast episodes under Watching and listening; newsletters worth a minute under Reading with the sender named. Each opens a chat with the right first step, such as adding an event to your calendar.
  - **An evening edition.** Turn it on in Discover settings for a second, shorter edition at 19:00 that looks at tomorrow. It never makes an episode or a Perch.
  - **Poly knows your week.** Poly's own thread and its daily look around read what Discover gathered, so Poly can be specific about what you have been listening to, reading and watching without re-reading your services.
  - **File things in a notebook from anywhere.** Ask Poly to put a page, a note or some files in a notebook by name, and it will, creating the notebook only when you ask.
  - **Send Studio work on.** A finished report, deck or table in a notebook's Studio has a Send menu for Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets and DEV when they are connected. Each send runs through the notebook chat and asks before it writes.
  - **Marquee records what you watch.** Tell Poly what you watched, are watching or want to see, with a rating and your thoughts, and it saves that to your Marquee shelf after you approve. Connectors without live discovery, such as Marquee, Last.fm and Trakt, now tell Poly their operations and fields instead of failing.
  - **A real feed.** Discover now reads the day's headlines for where you are, the front page of Hacker News, and, when Reddit is connected, the best posts from your communities. Every interest is researched from the news of the last three days, with the publisher and date kept. Poly's picks lead the edition, and up to three stories per interest, Reddit and Hacker News fill the Reading section beneath them, never repeating a link you have already seen. Your recent chats only shape the edition when nothing else is known about you yet.
  - **Discover documents explain themselves.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook now reads as a page: when it was read, what was found, and the raw result underneath. A service that could not be read says why. YouTube is read as your subscriptions and recent likes rather than your own uploads.
  - **Fixes.** The first edition after enabling Discover now gathers from your services before it is written, instead of being composed from recent chat titles alone. The Perch's captions follow the audio instead of jumping to the end, and loading a skill with a leading slash in its path no longer fails.

- 06c02dd: Discover is your morning edition from Poly. Open Discover in the Chat sidebar, turn it on, and each morning Poly leaves a brief, painted topic tiles, reading, automations worth setting up and the odd check-in, built from what you've been talking about.

  - Pick any card to open it beside the feed with its own conversation, then tell Discover more, less or never. Follow a topic and it gets a notebook that collects each day's best links.
  - The Perch is a short two-host round-up of each edition, in your podcast show and its private feed.
  - Today's episode is a narrated, illustrated part of a five-day season on your top topic, with chapters, camera moves and a listen-only mode. Save a season as one long listen for your podcast app.
  - Wind down makes a five, ten or twenty minute breathing, body-scan or unwind session for the evening. It starts speaking within seconds, over quiet music made for the session that you can turn off.
  - Today's episode, The Perch and Wind down share one player beside the feed, and keep playing while you read other cards.
  - Connect Readwise, Last.fm, Trakt, Hardcover or Podcast Index, and Discover reads what you're reading, listening to and watching. Notebooks can now keep connected sources up to date.
  - From before cards bring back flashcards you missed, links you saved a while ago and what you were doing a year ago.
  - On Sundays, Your week is a short private recap of what you made, learned and finished.
  - Turn on Tell me when it's ready and Poly lets you know on your phone and connected channels when the edition lands.
  - Settings lists your connected services, each with its own switch for Discover. Oura and Audiobookshelf can now be connected too, and on iPhone Discover can use yesterday's Apple Health summary for the brief.
  - Health, sexuality, religion, politics and money only appear when you follow them or ask. Episodes and their quizzes and flashcards land in a followed topic's notebook, and episodes open in Files with the same player.
  - Audio and video across chat, Files and notebooks now use one player.
  - The product tour now lives at /tour. On iOS, Discover is in the menu and there is a Today widget.
  - Long structured generations no longer give up after 100 seconds, so episodes and other background work finish instead of failing part way.
  - Podcasts and episodes now show their real length and jump to the right place when you scrub or resume.
  - Background work interrupted part way, by a deploy or a crash, now picks up again instead of sitting unfinished.

- abf8eb7: A rebuilt iPhone app, and approvals that go back together.

  - **Four tabs on iPhone.** Home shows your Discover edition, morning or evening, with the brief, topics, links and the episode, The Perch, your week and wind down, each with its real status and artwork. Chats has a Chat and Work toggle for your own conversations and your projects. Attention gathers approvals, questions, reviews, your inbox and background tasks, with a badge on the app icon. Settings covers your account, default model, Discover, Apple Health and notifications.
  - **Replies stream properly on iPhone.** Text arrives as it is written, each step of a reply that uses tools shows in order, chats open at the latest message, and headings, lists, quotes, code and tables render the way they do on the web.
  - **iPhone keeps up with your other devices.** Conversations, running work and Attention update live when something changes on the web or desktop.
  - **Widgets show what's happening.** The Today, Attention and Poly widgets come in small, medium and large sizes and on the Lock Screen, with the latest edition, what's waiting on you and what Poly is working on.
  - **Approvals arrive as one set.** When Poly asks for several approvals at once, decide each one (or approve or reject the rest in one go) and Polychat sends every decision together once the set is complete, so Poly carries on with all of them rather than one at a time. This works on the web, desktop and iPhone.
  - **Voice and Apple Health from iPhone.** Dictation and the Apple Health switch work again from the app.

- 7b5038c: The desktop app can share what you do on your Mac with Discover and Poly.

  - **Choose what to share.** Open Profile, then Mac activity, in the desktop app and switch on any of: browsing in Helium, Chrome, Brave, Arc, Edge, Vivaldi or Chromium; Claude Code and Codex sessions; time in the apps you use; and what Apple Music or Spotify played. Everything starts off.
  - **Lines leave, files don't.** The Mac reads history and transcripts itself and sends only short summary lines, such as a site with your visit count and time spent, or a project with its session title and prompt count. Page titles, searches, window titles and first prompts each have their own switch.
  - **Pause from the menu bar.** The Poly menu says what's being shared and lets you pause for an hour, until tomorrow or until you resume. Anything you did while paused is never sent, even after you resume.
  - **See exactly what was sent.** The settings tab shows the last send line by line. Mark any site, app or project as never shared, or forget everything this Mac sent.
  - **Discover and Poly use it straight away.** Each source appears in the Discover notebook as a document for your Mac, so morning editions and Poly's sense of your week include it. Switch a Mac source off in Discover settings to stop using it there.

- 80fee8e: MCP tools can now show their own interface in a conversation, and Polychat can be used as a tool from other assistants.

  - **Apps inside the chat.** When a connected MCP integration ships an interface for a tool (the MCP Apps extension), Polychat renders it in the reply in a sandboxed frame: pickers, tables, small dashboards. The app can refresh its own data through read-only tools; anything that would change something still goes through the conversation so it can ask you first.
  - **Polychat as an MCP server.** Point Claude, ChatGPT, Codex or any MCP client at the /mcp endpoint with a Polychat API key and it can run the same tools you can run in Polychat, and ask any of your teammates to take on a job. Anything that needs approval waits for you in Polychat.

- 8b965f6: Conversation groups are now notebooks. Click a notebook's name in the sidebar to open it: your sources on the left, the chat in the middle and Studio on the right. Every chat in a notebook answers from the sources you tick, names the source behind each claim, and can search the notebook's earlier chats too.

  - Add sources from Files, uploads, web pages or pasted text, or search the web from the notebook. Fast research finds pages to pick from; deep research writes a report in the background and brings back the pages it cites.
  - Studio makes audio overviews, slide decks, video overviews, mind maps, reports, flashcards, quizzes, infographics and data tables from the ticked sources. The pencil on each tile lets you choose the format, length, style, language and focus.
  - Flashcards and quizzes remember how you got on. Click any topic in a mind map to ask about it.
  - Save any reply as a note, and turn a note into a source when you want chats to read it.
  - Configure a notebook to answer as a learning guide or a persona of your own, at the length you like, from its sources only or with the web as well.

- 0a57f73: Open any file and ask about it.

  - **One viewer for every file.** Documents, sources, recordings, images and memories all open in the same viewer. The title menu holds file info, version history, share links and every conversation about the file. Files opened from a chat, a run or a task open on top of where you were.
  - **Ask about this file.** The viewer has its own conversation. Polychat reads the file fresh on every turn, can revise a document as a new revision you can restore, and keeps the conversation with the file so you can pick it up later.
  - **Poly knows the page you are on.** Each place has a guide Poly reads whenever you ask it something there, and a fresh Poly conversation opens with that guide and a few starters. Your first chat opens with the guide to conversations.
  - **API.** Pass `conversation.subject` with `{ type, id }` when creating a response to start a conversation about a source, output or memory, and list them with `GET /conversations?subject_type=&subject_id=`. `GET /skills/guides` returns each place's guide.

- 11381a9: Teammates are now people you message, not settings you edit.

  - **Teammate threads.** Opening a teammate opens its own conversation, which carries on between visits. The sidebar lists the teammates you are talking to and your groups, newest activity first, with anyone who needs you at the top. Those conversations no longer also appear in the chat list. The conversation uses the same workspace as any other chat, and its side panel sums up the teammate: what it is doing, its autonomy, and how many routines and connections it has, each a click from Working context.
  - **Groups.** Use "Add a teammate" on a teammate's page to put two to six teammates in one conversation. Use @name, or tap a name in the header, to choose who answers. Every reply shows which teammate wrote it, and messages teammates send back while they work collapse into one "Messages from…" line you can open.
  - **Reactions.** React to a reply from the smiley button, or long-press on iOS. 👍 and 👎 also tell the teammate how it did, and teammates react 👀 to your message when they pick it up instead of replying "On it". A reaction never approves anything.
  - **Receipts.** When a tool sends, books, pays, deletes or changes something, the conversation shows a short receipt such as "Created routine · Friday inbox tidy · every Friday at 09:00", with the full output one click away.
  - **Live with teammates.** Live now works in teammate and group conversations. Start it from the Live button and stop it from the same place; each spoken turn goes to the teammate with its tools, and anything it wants to do still waits for your approval.
  - **Slack and Telegram signals.** Connected channels react 👀 when a message is picked up, show a working status in Slack threads and swap to ⚠️ if the run fails. Choose "Also ✅ when it is done" or "No reactions" when you connect a channel.
  - **More teammates to hire.** New jobs for personal admin, productivity, sales and marketing, operations and engineering, including Inbox tidy, Trip watcher, Morning brief, Meeting prep, Bug reproduction and Expense manager. Each arrives with its own character and offers to set up its routine.
  - **Dry runs.** Run any set-up routine as a dry run. Anything that would send, write, spend or delete returns a draft instead, so you can check a routine before it goes live.
  - **Batch review.** When three or more approvals are waiting, tick the ones you want and approve them together. Each is still approved on its own, exactly as listed.

- 91c7d3d: Choose how the assistant responds without writing a prompt.

  - **Style controls.** Personalised responses now has dropdowns for base style and tone (Professional, Friendly, Candid, Quirky, Efficient, Nerdy or Cynical), warmth, enthusiasm, emoji, and headers and lists. Leave any on Default to keep the assistant's usual behaviour.
  - **Custom instructions on top.** Your own traits and preferences sit below the controls and are added to the style you pick, so you can choose a tone and still add anything the controls do not cover. Instructions you have already written carry on working unchanged.

- 7b36da1: Sources is now where your media lives. Files' Given tab is renamed Sources and gains Podcasts, Image Studio and Replicate alongside the library.

  - Upload images, audio and video straight into Sources. Open any audio or video source to play it, transcribe it, write notes with decisions and action items, and make cover art. The transcript becomes searchable, so recordings work as grounding like any other source. This replaces the Recording Processor app.
  - Image Studio, sketch-to-painting and Replicate runs now save what they make into Sources, where it can be reused as material. They have moved out of Apps and the Canvas sidebar item into Files › Sources.
  - Make podcasts from your sources: pick sources, a format (deep dive, brief, debate or critique) and a length, and two hosts talk it through. Each episode lands in Sources with its audio, transcript, show notes and cover.
  - Group episodes into shows and create a private RSS feed link to subscribe in any podcast app. Making a new link turns off the old one.
  - Ask Poly or a teammate to make an episode with the new podcast tool, or install the Podcast Briefing recipe to get a fresh episode on your topics or Sources on a schedule.

- 80fee8e: Your teammates can now be reached by other agents over Agent2Agent. Each teammate has an agent card at `/a2a/teammates/<id>/.well-known/agent-card.json`, and any A2A client holding your Polychat API key can send it work, stream its progress, check on a task later or cancel it. The teammate works in its own conversation and still asks you in Polychat before anything that sends, spends or deletes.
- 7a9f872: Teammates and routines now show what they cost and can be given a monthly budget.

  - **Spend on the teammate page.** A teammate's card shows the credits its runs have used this month, and the working context has a Spend section with the same figure against its cap.
  - **Monthly caps.** Set a cap in credits on a teammate's working context or on a routine. Once the month's spend reaches it, new runs are refused with a note saying why, a routine over its cap pauses itself with the reason shown, and everything resumes when the month resets or you raise the cap.
  - **Runs remember their routine.** Each run records which routine started it, so routine spend is exact rather than estimated.

- 7accf45: Mistral speech now runs on Voxtral 3, with a hosted voice agent for Live.

  - **Transcription.** Mistral transcription uses Voxtral Mini Transcribe 3, and you can pick Voxtral Small Transcribe 3 in Settings for higher accuracy. It detects the spoken language rather than assuming English, and timed transcripts now label who said what.
  - **Custom vocabulary.** Add names, acronyms and jargon under Settings → Audio, one per line, and Mistral transcription, live transcription and the voice agent will listen out for them.
  - **Live transcription.** Mistral live transcription uses Voxtral Mini Transcribe Realtime 3. Notes labels each speaker as they talk, and Live conversations use Mistral's own end-of-turn detection, so a thoughtful pause no longer cuts you off.
  - **Mistral Voice Agent.** Pick Mistral Voice in Live for a hosted Voxtral 3 agent that listens, searches the web when it needs to and answers aloud. It uses your Mistral key or the platform one, and you can interrupt it mid-sentence.
  - **Speech.** Mistral speech uses Voxtral TTS 3 with its new preset voices in over 20 languages. The default is Mary (English, UK). Choose how expressive the delivery is under Settings → Audio.
  - **Your voices.** Save a voice from an MP3 or WAV recording under Settings → Audio and use it for speech. Only you can use your saved voices, and you need to confirm the voice is yours or you have permission. The API offers the same through `/audio/voices`, and `/audio/speech` accepts `expressiveness`.

- d7716ff: Polychat on Apple Watch and Apple TV, and notifications you can act on.

  - **Approve from the notification.** Task approvals arrive with Approve and Decline buttons, single questions take a typed or dictated answer, and Poly's updates take a reply, all without opening the app. They work on the Lock Screen and on Apple Watch, and approvals and questions break through Focus as time-sensitive.
  - **Poly on your wrist.** The Apple Watch app lists what needs you and what Poly is working on, approves or declines tasks and runs, answers single questions, and asks Poly anything by dictation, with the answer read aloud if you like. Sign in with one tap from a nearby iPhone, or with a code at polychat.app/device.
  - **Complications.** Put a count of what needs you, or Poly's status and next item, on any watch face. The Poly Live Activity also shows in the watch's Smart Stack.
  - **Wind down on the watch.** Play today's Discover wind down, or record a new breathing, body scan or unwind session, through AirPods with each step on screen and a tap on the wrist as it moves on. Time spent listening is saved to Apple Health as mindful minutes.
  - **Discover on Apple TV.** Today's edition, the episode with its pictures and captions full screen, wind down and every card, with the day's picks on the Top Shelf. Sign in by scanning a code with your phone. An Apple TV gets a Discover-only key, so your chats, projects and files stay out of reach, and you can revoke it from Profile.
  - **AirPlay episodes.** Episodes and wind downs show in Now Playing on the Lock Screen, Control Center and Apple Watch. Send them to an Apple TV with the AirPlay button and the current picture comes along, or mirror your screen for the full picture with captions.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 82c133e: Eval suites can run as a provider batch on OpenAI and Anthropic routes, at about half the price, with results within 24 hours. A new `batch` provider category wraps the OpenAI Batch API and Anthropic Message Batches.
- 005b9f3: Add Bedrock Managed Agents as a remote agent harness. Project chats run on the AgentCore Runtime and execution role from the workspace AWS connection, personal chats on the Runtime and role in user settings with the personal Bedrock key. It shares the OpenAI Agents session stream.
- e820856: MCP tool results keep their PNG, JPEG and WebP images for models that read images, and tool-result images reach every provider as real image input instead of serialised base64 text. MCP server settings offer Inspo as a one-click server for design references.
- 7bec25b: Add Polychat Benchmarks: GeoGuess, Countdown, Fermi Bets, Long Odds, Hamster Wheel and Strudel Groove, run on one engine for official, personal and workspace scopes. Results at `/benchmarks` show intervals, Artificial Analysis indexes with attribution, measured cost and a medal table, people can play the auto-scored benchmarks and vote on blind pairs, the Benchmarks app runs them against your own models and keys, and the model selector previews each model's standings.
- 65fbf81: Add the newest live models. Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live runs transcription sessions (so Notes dictation can use Gemini) and Gemini 3.5 Live Translate runs translation sessions, both through the existing Live API token flow. GPT-Live 1 joins the OpenAI realtime models as a server-brokered WebRTC call with Responses delegation, so the browser never holds a project key.
- 65fbf81: Refresh the realtime providers and Note Taker. Notes dictation now runs on the shared live session with any ready transcription provider and commits OpenAI turns on silence. Gemini Live defaults to Gemini 3.8 Live, OpenAI transcription sends the `languages` field and drops the retired Whisper and GPT-4o models, translation sessions use the dedicated translations endpoints, and proxied transcription sessions settle billing on their measured audio instead of a flat reservation. The proxy audio cap now covers the full session length, Notes lists return excerpts with server-side search, metadata is only described once a note has enough text, and the unused video analysis options are gone.
- b97c227: Recording summaries now come from the auxiliary model as structured notes: a summary, the decisions and the action items with owner and due date when the recording states them. In a project, each action item can be added to the task board.
- c965c69: Sites can borrow colours and fonts from a public reference page. The computer sandbox reads the page's computed background, text, accent colours and font families, and the theme gains an optional custom palette and Google Fonts families that render over the named presets.
- 06e4619: Add two deterministic graders for summaries: `fact_coverage` scores the share of required facts (one per line in the case's expected value) an answer keeps, and `grounded_numbers` scores the share of the answer's numbers that appear in the case input.
- e41549c: Keep transcription timings. Providers return segments and words, `/audio/transcribe?timestamps=true` includes them, notes from media quote real `[m:ss]` markers instead of guessing, and recordings play captions and download them as SRT or VTT.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6967a07: Host agent harnesses on Polychat's own ports. The agent worker now runs the Pi and OpenCode harnesses and a Hermes container behind one RPC contract, with models served by the API's OpenAI-compatible `/agents/model` port, workspace tools gated by the permission mode, and every reply streamed into chat as it is generated. OpenAI Agents joins as a remote harness through the same `agent-harness` chat provider. The sandbox worker moves to Sandbox SDK 1.0 with app-owned `Workspace` and `Computer` classes, absorbs the computer worker, and keeps caches and browser profiles with `DirectoryBackup`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6967a07]
  - @ngriffin_uk/polychat-utility-core@0.3.1

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ece96c4: Add the AI function, agent, tool, workflow and task primitives. `ai-functions` exposes task-shaped calls (`generateText`, `generateObject`, `classify`, `extract`, media and retrieval) over a provider runtime. `ai-agents` builds `Agent` on the decision loop and tool catalogues, and replaces `agent-core` in every host. `library-tools` replaces `library-tool-runtime` and the tool registry schema with definitions, catalogues, validation and execution. `library-tasks` adds outcome settlement, execution leases, handler registries, polling and cron schedules and status machines, and `ai-workflows` wraps them in `on`/`poll`/`every` so the API declares queued tasks, self-rescheduling pollers (now with an attempt cap) and cron jobs in one registry.
- 33133cc: Centralise every authored prompt in a catalogue and a retrieval package. `library-prompts-catalogue` holds all prompt text and fragments as data with a validating schema, variables and conditionals; `ai-prompts` retrieves entries by id, task or variant, renders `{{variable}}` templates, and composes the chat, meta-assistant, sandbox, memory, document, agent, sandbox-worker, provider and panel prompts. Hardcoded prompts are removed from `ai-providers` (image styles and guardrail policies), `ai-functions` (task system prompts), `ai-agents`, `schemas` (council member prompts, teammate and platform teammate briefs) and the API and sandbox worker services, which now source their text from the catalogue.
- d3f1df3: Canvas is a place, not a mode toggle. Chat and Work sidebars link to it above Files; opening it in Work asks for a project first, like a new chat, and keeps what it makes with that project.
- 3c23660: When a teammate started from a Slack, Telegram or email thread hands work to a delegate, the follow-up it writes once that work reports back is now sent to the same thread. The sender mapping and binding are rechecked before sending, and each follow-up is delivered at most once.
- d25fd94: Let people reach Polychat by email. A personal email binding is keyed by the address you write from, linked with the usual one-time command, and answered by threaded plain-text replies. Inbound mail arrives through the Worker email handler and is only accepted when a DKIM signature aligned with its From domain also covers the To or Cc header naming Polychat's inbox, so forged senders and replayed messages are refused. Auto-replies are ignored to avoid loops.
- 5ead2cc: Import GitHub and Linear issues into Work and review exact GitHub PR revisions manually or through signed automatic intake. Retain captured Sources and review Outputs, isolate each workspace and credential owner, and approve publication separately.

  Apply migration `0061_project_task_integrations` before deployment. Configure the GitHub webhook secret and pull-request events for automatic intake, and pull-request write permission for publication.

- dd4389b: Let React artifacts show live data and charts. An artifact can declare read-only connector reads in a leading `<bindings>` block and read them with `usePolychatData` from `@polychat/data`. The host runs each read through the API, which takes the declaration from the stored message, refuses operations that change anything, only lets a refetch change declared arguments, caches results for a minute and rate-limits each artifact. React artifacts now compile with Sucrase instead of Babel standalone, can import `recharts`, and are assembled without string replacement, so `$` sequences and `</script>` in component source no longer corrupt the page.
- 462cbe7: Record how long providers keep API prompts and replies. Model configs gain an optional `dataRetention` block with the documented maximum days, how zero retention is reached (`default`, `account_setting` or `on_request`) and the policy URL. OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini API, Groq, Mistral and Bedrock carry their published defaults, and the model picker's hover preview shows them with a link to the policy.
- b105d00: Require budget checks and approval for deployment resumes and scale increases. Wait for provider provisioning and deletion to finish before marking dedicated deployments deleted, and expose unsupported pause controls in host capabilities.

  Claim the paid continuation after a Together upload so concurrent polls cannot create duplicate endpoints. Preserve uncertain continuation outcomes for reconciliation.

  Preserve input withdrawals on completed training outputs and check current route approval for Chat and custom evaluation judges. Pass validation data to embedding training and run GGUF conversion with checked argument lists.

- c126d04: Add model governance to Work. Workspaces can search Hugging Face, import models and datasets pinned to a commit, and review static inspection evidence that never loads the weights. Approvals follow versioned policies with dry runs, exceptions and expiry. Suites can be compared across serving routes with confidence intervals, and fine-tunes run on Hugging Face Jobs from governed conversation snapshots with lineage and a compute record. Approved versions can be served on dedicated Inference Endpoints, drift is caught by nightly replays, and any route or version exports as a CycloneDX ML-BOM. Workspaces can enforce approved routes in project chats, and generations carry route and version tags. Each workspace connects its own Hugging Face account or organisation under Govern, with the platform token as an optional default, and retiring a deployed route deletes its endpoint. Training moves from Profile to Models › Build, and Hub staging for Bedrock imports is keyed by commit.
- b105d00: Expose approved workspace aliases in Chat, resolve each alias once per request, and enforce workspace membership, current approval and deployment availability. Apply promotion checks to initial targets and rollbacks, and create deployment aliases without a target until explicitly promoted.

  Claim spend approvals before execution to prevent duplicate starts. Add executing and failed request states, enforce separate approval when configured, and recheck budgets before starting approved work.

  Preserve multipart upload progress under concurrent requests and order alias approval events reliably when timestamps tie. Keep internal evaluation and synthetic dataset calls scoped to their workspace deployment.

- 90f7110: Turn Work › Models into a model platform on the workspace's own provider accounts. Connect Hugging Face, AWS, Together, Fireworks, Nebius, Google Vertex, Azure AI Foundry, RunPod, Cloudflare Workers AI or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, then upload weights or register them from a bucket, build governed datasets from files, the Hub, buckets, rated conversations or a teacher model, and train with supervised, preference, reinforcement, distillation, embedding, merge or quantise runs after comparing trainers on fit and cost. Deployments are sized and priced per host, serve through aliases with eval gates, canaries and rollback, and appear in chat as models. Governance adds per-action permissions with separation of duties, budgets with spend approval, idle pause, revocation across lineage, erasure requests, an audit trail and CycloneDX, SPDX, model card and training content exports.

  The personal Training app, the training Worker and `component-experiences/training` are removed, and the API now mounts the platform under `/model-platform`.

- b105d00: Claim provider creation atomically to prevent duplicate training jobs and deployments. Preserve cancellation requests during submission, expose the cancelling state, and register jobs that finish immediately. Recheck model approval before creation and require reconciliation for interrupted provider requests.

  Settle hosting intervals and replace training costs atomically, and preserve accrued costs when pausing, scaling or deleting a deployment. Apply migration 0055 before deploying the API.

- 251ac59: Use remote MCP servers with any model. When MCP is enabled and the model has no hosted MCP tool, or a server's credential belongs to Polychat, the turn gets `mcp_list_tools` and `mcp_call_tool`, which call the server directly through a new Streamable HTTP client. Calls are classed as writes, so they follow the same approvals as other external writes, and only the tools a connection allows can run. MCP connections can now sign in with OAuth (discovery, dynamic client registration, PKCE and refresh) with tokens stored encrypted, and token connections can be kept for Polychat instead of OpenAI.
- 41bb6a8: Short skills can now apply themselves to the messages they help with. A skill marked `activation: per-message` (or saved with "apply automatically") is considered before each turn and, when it clearly fits, its instructions are added to that turn only, without a `load_skill` call. Selection has a 1.5 second deadline and never blocks the reply.
- 67b52ed: Give Poly an agenda. `GET /poly/agenda` derives what needs the person, what Poly is working on and what it finished this week from the Poly thread's delegations, goal and latest run, with no new storage. Poly's prompt carries the agenda each turn, the overlay shows it above the thread, and the sidebar's Ask Poly button shows Poly's status. The agenda refreshes on the live delegation, goal and run events for the Poly thread.
- 67b52ed: Budget Poly's interruptions. Routines Poly sets up from its thread now report back to it, and each routine result passes through a judged, budgeted handoff before it reaches the person: results waiting on them always interrupt, failures and results a decision policy rates as urgent interrupt within five a day and thirty minutes apart, and everything else is noted quietly. Each occurrence is decided once and recorded as a `poly.handoffs` activity on the Poly thread, and the agenda, Poly's prompt and the overlay list what was noted and why.
- ee31a6d: Make Poly a platform teammate with one continuous thread per person. `POLY_TEAMMATE` is synced like the other platform teammates but kept out of rosters, `GET /poly/home` opens the person's Poly context and its `poly` home conversation, and the overlay always opens that thread through the Poly teammate. Poly runs only in its owner's thread, a Poly thread only runs as Poly, and navigation tools are offered only on turns the person started.
- ee31a6d: Call the Poly by its name everywhere. The `meta` conversation type is now `poly`, the `meta_assistant` request field is now `poly`, and the meta assistant contracts, prompts, tools, hooks and overlay are renamed to match (`POLY_NAVIGATION_TOOL_NAMES`, `polyRequestSchema`, `buildPolyPrompt`, `PolyOverlay`, `usePolyNavigation`). A data migration moves stored `meta` conversations to `poly`. Behaviour is unchanged.
- 67b52ed: Let people approve a Poly write once and for all, for one destination. When Poly at the assistant level waits on a write with a known destination, the approval card offers "Always allow here". The server derives the tool and destination from the stored pending call and keeps the approval on the Poly context for thirty days, where a Cedar condition lets matching writes run unattended. Sends, spending, deletes, credentials and exports still ask every time. Approvals are listed in Poly's autonomy menu and can be revoked there.
- ee31a6d: Let Poly do things in its thread. Poly's grants now cover delegation, goals, memory, research, documents, notes, skills and automations alongside navigation, its thread uses the standard chat prompt with its persona and memory, and `buildStandardChatPrompt` takes a `poly` option that adds Poly's behaviour and the person's current place. `buildPolyPrompt` is removed.
- 6966643: Grant selected actions from existing connectors directly to projects through Plugins, without creating a recipe. Reuse personal accounts, the connector catalogue, project capabilities and existing execution approvals. Preserve exclusions and narrower recipe permissions.
- 1e5cafb: Let `ask_user` ask for a file. A question can set `requestsFile`, the question card offers an "Attach a file" button for it, and the chosen files are uploaded with the same model rules as composer attachments and sent with the answers.
- 462cbe7: Queue follow-ups while a Chat reply is running. The composer stays open during a reply and queues what you type, up to ten messages per conversation, listed above the composer and removable. Queued messages are held as suspended `queued_chat_message` tasks and the next one is released when the run ends, so they send in order even after the tab closes. Work keeps steering the run instead.
- e4ba666: Start a recipe from any service with a private webhook URL. Each webhook can carry an "only run when" condition, can be paused, rotated or deleted, and honours an Idempotency-Key header so retries do not run twice. Payloads reach the recipe as untrusted data and never carry authority. Composio and webhook events now share one admission path.
- 6e76041: Resume delegations whose run was interrupted instead of failing them. Tool calls left without a result are settled first: reads may run again, anything else is reported as of unknown outcome so it is never repeated automatically. A delegation resumes at most twice, before its deadline, within the steps and credit it has left.
- d3f1df3: Automations leave the teammates library for their own Scheduled place. The Chat and Work sidebars link to it under Teammates, and the recipe cards, filters, schedule dialogs and deep links move with it.
- 57f8a16: Add Sites, a generative site builder that works from one brief. Jev classifies the brief into a plan (kind, scope, tone, palette, model tier), a tier-selected coding model streams the site as JSON Patch lines against a guardrailed component catalogue, and the shell renders every patch the moment it lands. `library-sites` holds the catalogue, patch stream compiler, validator and repair, prompt assembly, theme tokens and a deterministic Next.js and Tailwind code generator; `component-sites` holds the live React registry, themed preview and code view. Sites persist as revisioned outputs, refine in follow-ups, export as runnable project files, and hand off to a project's sandbox for a full build. The SSE buffer parser now lives once in `utility-core`. Sites are interactive (state, bindings, visibility, repeat, filters and actions in both the live renderer and the generated code), editable in place through an element inspector with zero-token edits and scoped refinement, exportable straight to a pull request with generated images, embeddable in chat through the `build_site` tool, revisioned with restore and public preview links, and judged by Jev at planning, refinement, quality-scoring and prompt-evaluation time.
- 07290f2: Add a teammate autonomy dial. A teammate context can be an observer, an assistant or a partner, enforced by Cedar over each call's effect class: observers only read and draft, assistants ask before writes, partners write within their grants, and sends, spending, deletes, credentials and exports always ask. Poly starts as an assistant and its overlay can change the level. Run triggers now reach tool availability and execution, so Poly's navigation gate holds there too.
- cb9ddcc: Declare what each tool changes. `TOOL_EFFECT_CLASSES` names eight effect classes, `ToolDefinition.effects` declares a tool's class and destination, and `resolveToolEffectClass` treats an undeclared tool as a write. The API's built-in catalogue now refuses a tool without effects, and `call_api` and `use_recipe_connector` classify each call from its input.

### Patch Changes

- 6db7a00: Add the experimentation primitives. `library-flags` is an OpenFeature-shaped evaluation contract with a rules provider (deterministic bucketing from the targeting key, weighted splits, targeting, enable gates), a Cloudflare Flagship binding adapter and a layered provider that lets the dashboard override code. `ai-experiments` defines flags and experiments in code, assigns users with `feature_flag.evaluation` exposure events, runs work under an assignment, tracks outcomes with assignments attached, and runs offline variant sweeps with metrics. The API wires a per-request `Experiments` into the service context, tags AI generation telemetry with `experiment.<key>` properties, gates the flagged cron tasks through flags whose defaults come from the existing environment toggles, accepts an optional `FLAGS` Flagship binding, and serves `GET /flags/bootstrap`. Cron `enabledWhen` may now be asynchronous.
- b4c0c65: Add user feedback capture to telemetry. `captureAiFeedback` fans thumbs feedback out to a new AI Gateway sink that patches the stored log (when the message has a log id) and to PostHog as a survey response linked to the chat run trace that produced the message. Provider generation events now use the chat run as `$ai_trace_id` (falling back to the conversation) so feedback and generations link in AI Observability. The chat feedback endpoint accepts a `message_id`, resolves the message, run id, log id and trace id on the backend, and attributes feedback to the latest assistant message when clients send only the conversation. The frontend sends the message id and always shows feedback prompts on assistant messages.
- 169e2f5: Add the Polychat CLI, which pairs a terminal, server or gateway through a device code instead of a pasted API key, and show it on the downloads page. The device approval page now shows the code as cells, the requesting client, its expiry and what approval grants. Device sign-in clients no longer trip bot detection when they start and poll.

### Minor Changes

- 4789c96: Announce the desktop's notifications from the task inbox the iOS application already uses, rather than a poller of its own.

  The first pass built a parallel system: it polled Work Attention, decided for itself which kinds were worth announcing, and kept its own idea of what counted as unread. Polychat already has a task notification system — a server-side inbox with read receipts, dismissal, per-item deep links and per-category preferences — and the iOS client consumes it through `TaskNotificationManager`. The desktop now consumes the same one.

  - `library-react` publishes `useTaskInbox`, the inbox query with its read and dismiss receipts. The web application had no inbox hook at all; only iOS had one, in Swift.
  - `useTaskNotificationSettings` is separated out of `useTaskNotifications`, so a surface can read the account's preferences without dragging web push registration along.
  - `polychat-schemas` publishes `taskNotificationCategoryForAttentionKind` and `isTaskNotificationCategoryEnabled`, so a client gates announcements on exactly the categories the server gates push on, rather than a hand-written list.

  What stays device-local is only what has to be: whether _this_ machine has already put a given item on screen. Announcing is not reading — a notification shown on your Mac must not mark the item read for your phone — so the ledger stays in the desktop's own database while unread, categories and the item list all come from the server.

  The badge now shows the inbox's own unread count. Desktop notifications are not clickable: `tauri-plugin-notification` exposes action handling on mobile only, so acting on an item still means opening the window.

- 4789c96: Correct how the desktop window and the desktop host talk to the Polychat API.

  The window renewed its access token on a blind ten minute timer against a token the API mints for fifteen minutes and stops reissuing with five minutes left. A laptop that slept through a tick woke holding a token nobody would renew, and every request failed until the next tick happened to land. The host now reports `expiresIn` alongside the token, and the window renews from that lifetime and again whenever the window regains focus or the machine comes back online.

  The packaged content security policy also refused the API origin, so avatars, uploads and generated images never rendered in the packaged application even though the same markup worked on the web. `img-src`, `media-src` and `connect-src` now admit the API and the avatar hosts the account menu reads, and a test holds the packaged and development policies to that.

  Other corrections:

  - A run whose Rust command refused — an endpoint that is no longer configured, a runtime the egress rules will not reach — closed its event stream silently, leaving the composer waiting on a reply that never came. The bridge now reports the refusal as a failed run, and an event this version cannot parse fails the run rather than hanging it.
  - Pairing secrets saved against a model runtime were stored and never sent. Probing, model discovery and model runs now carry them, as agent runs already did.
  - A model or agent run could leave its identifier in the cancellation registry when the HTTP client refused to build, so a later run reusing that identifier started cancelled.
  - The window now refuses to start against an API origin the host was not built for, rather than signing in against one API and calling another.
  - A transport error from a request carrying a pairing secret or the session cookie was stringified straight into the message the window shows. Those failures are now described by what went wrong and which runtime it was, so a credential or an address cannot be repeated back through an error.

  `polychat-schemas` publishes `desktopSessionTokenSchema` for the host's token reply and `isSameOrigin` alongside the other navigation guards.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 0a2d695: Move prompt-shaped tooling into skills, and reserve function tools for real capability.

  Seven built-in skills replace features that were previously prompt behaviour in tool or prompt-mode
  form: `prompt-craft`, `tutoring`, `structured-reasoning`, `task-decomposition`, `council`,
  `hacker-news`, and `article-analysis`.

  Breaking changes:

  - `councilChatOptionsSchema`, `COUNCIL_APP_ID`, and the `@ngriffin_uk/polychat-schemas/council-data`
    subpath are removed. `councilMembers` and `councilMemberIds` remain on the package root.
  - `chatRequestOptions.council` is removed with no replacement, and the Home Council mode goes with
    it. Council is reached from ordinary chat through its skill and `/council` command.
  - `homeChatModeId` drops `council`.
  - `component-conversation` no longer exports `CouncilChatControls`, and messages no longer carry
    `data.council`; `library-chat` drops the matching message-data type.
  - `component-content` no longer exports `TutorView`.
  - `skillRequirement` gains `suggestedTools`, and `skillCategory` gains `Reasoning`.
  - Authored skill documents accept an optional `resources` array.

  Removed API surface: `POST /apps/prompt-coach`, `POST /apps/retrieval/tutor`, and the
  `prompt_coach`, `tutor`, `add_reasoning_step`, `compose_functions`, `if_then_else`,
  `parallel_execute`, `retry_with_backoff`, `fallback`, and `analyse_hacker_news` tools.

  Added: `run_council`, backed by a reusable panel primitive that debates a question turn by turn on
  the conversation's model, streaming each member's turn into the chat as it lands and letting each
  turn route to the next speaker until the chamber converges; and `get_hacker_news_stories`, which
  returns front-page data without an auxiliary-model pass.

  `select_council_members` raises a member picker in the conversation, pre-ticked with the members the
  model recommends, so the user convenes the council themselves.

  The composer now de-duplicates slash commands by name. A mode and a skill can share one — Council is
  both — and two identical `/` entries are indistinguishable to the person typing; the mode wins,
  because selecting it pins the skill anyway.

  `component-content` gains `CouncilTurnView` and `CouncilMemberPickerView`, and exports a shared
  `ToolInteractionHandler` type. Tool interactions gain a `submitPrompt` action alongside
  `useAsPrompt`, for views whose control is itself the decision.

### Minor Changes

- 40048e2: Add GPT-6 Astra model presentation and extend model and chat contracts for OpenAI prompt-cache controls, asynchronous tools, reasoning configuration updates, and long-context billing.
- 588f262: Add a conversation list actions menu that archives or restores everything matching the current filters.

  `component-navigation` gains `ConversationListActions`, a kebab menu that sits beside the filter control. It offers "Archive all (N)" on an active list and "Restore all (N)" on an archived one, and withholds the action under the mixed `all` status where the count would not describe what changes.

  `schemas` publishes `bulkArchiveChatCompletionsJsonSchema` for the new `PATCH /chat/completions` endpoint, which matches on the same title and activity filters as the list and only moves conversations that are not already in the requested state. `ConversationListPage` now carries `total`, so a count can describe the whole filtered set rather than the loaded page.

  `compareConversationsBySort` is exported so clients can order a list the same way the API does, rather than re-sorting by date and dropping the title sort.

- ac5b12e: Replace the conversation list's stacked selects with a nested options menu, and extend what it can filter.

  `component-ui` gains `OptionsMenu`, a submenu-per-setting menu whose rows carry their current value and check the selected option. `ConversationListControls` now takes a single `filters` object plus `onFiltersChange` and `onReset` instead of one prop pair per setting, and adds a last-activity window and a grouping choice alongside status and sort. `ConversationGroup` requires an `id` and treats `title` as optional so an ungrouped list renders without headings.

  `schemas` publishes `conversationArchiveFilterSchema`, `conversationSortBySchema`, and `conversationActivityWindowSchema`. The activity window is resolved to an absolute cutoff by whoever owns the calendar: `conversationActivityCutoff` returns the local start-of-day boundary, and clients send it as an `updated_after` timestamp rather than asking the API to interpret a symbolic window. `filterConversationsByListOptions` applies the same cutoff to device-local conversations, honours the new title sort, and accepts an explicit `now`.

- 42c36ea: Release the applications from changesets. Merging a changeset that names an application versions it, tags it and publishes a GitHub release with its changelog entry; the desktop release also carries macOS, Windows and Linux archives built on their own runners. The API serves those archives from `/desktop/downloads` and answers the desktop updater from `/desktop/releases`, so neither the website nor the application needs to know where the builds are hosted.
- e2ffadb: Add model-declared processing tiers and a Fast processing selector for compatible conversation models.
- d841b16: Add thread-scoped goals. A goal is a completion contract owned by a conversation or a sandbox run: it shapes the system prompt, survives turns, and only completes against an evidence ledger. Termination is behavioural — completed, blocked, stalled, or limit reached — with no iteration cap.
- 6334297: Move the shipped render implementations into their packages and replace the placeholder interfaces.

  Host seams added so render modules stay portable:

  - `component-ui` exposes `LinkProvider`, `Link`, and `NavLink`; hosts pass resolved hrefs and supply
    their own router.
  - `library-surface` defines `SurfaceAnalytics`, and `library-react` exposes `AnalyticsProvider` and
    `useAnalytics`, so render modules report events without knowing the provider.
  - `component-content` exposes `CustomResponseViewProvider`, so tool responses that need host data
    are registered by the application and unknown names fall back to the raw JSON view.

  Render ownership:

  - `component-ui`: page shell frame and header registry, page primitives, empty and sign-in states,
    loading spinner, page skeletons, and the file uploader presentation.
  - `component-models`: the provider icon registry and `ProviderGlyph`, Artificial Analysis panel,
    model options and lists, auto-router picker, hover preview, and the controlled selector trigger
    and panel.
  - `component-navigation`: sidebar parts, settings popover, theme and more-options menus,
    conversation list and controls, storage notice, and the search dialog.
  - `component-capabilities`: capability and app cards, experience grid, capability theme helpers,
    dynamic tool form, tool configuration dialog, tool result card, and the recipe card and dialogs.
  - `component-content`: generated response views, artefact classification, actions, callout, inline
    preview, document editor, and the sandboxed artefact renderers.
  - `component-conversation`: message content, actions, tool and function messages, citations,
    reasoning, search grounding, connector approval, agent trace, composer input and menus, council
    controls, keyboard shortcuts, and the welcome screen.
  - `component-account`: account sidebar shell, agent, team, connector, and provider views, the user
    settings form, and the provider and connector credential modals.
  - `component-workspaces`: workspace and project cards, member, invitation, governance, knowledge,
    coding environment, and activity views, Work sidebar navigation, and the create/invite dialogs.
  - `component-experiences`: article, note, and podcast presentation under `/content`; canvas and
    drawing under `/media`; the Strudel player under `/music` with the runtime as an optional peer;
    training panels and forms under `/training`.

  Shared behaviour moved below the render layer:

  - `schemas`: chat modes, model selection, region variants, provider display, token formatting,
    auto-router modes, reasoning helpers, recipe presentation, article report contracts, connector
    approval parsing, and model tool configuration parsing.
  - `library-chat`: the conversation message contract plus message, artefact, agent-trace, opinion,
    branching, compaction, speech, composer-command, and tool-result helpers, each on its own subpath.
  - `utility-core` gains `generateId`, `formatBytes`, and `getErrorMessage`; `utility-react` gains
    `useFileUpload` and `containsEventTarget`.

- fc4ed91: Add project task boards to Work. A task is a durable, project-scoped objective that carries its own conversation and goal, so work lives somewhere other than one person's scrollback. Board columns are the task's own lifecycle; a completed goal lands in review and only a person accepts it. Runs execute with the starting member's own connections, and everything waiting on a person aggregates into one attention list. Agents become a project capability so a flow stage can name one, with the agent's tools intersected with the project's rather than unioned.
- 1836aad: Give a project task the fields a work item needs: acceptance criteria as separate checkable items, an expected deliverable, context, constraints including tools withheld from the run, dependencies that gate a start, a per-task approval policy, priority and a due date. Enforced fields and descriptive ones are stated separately so neither is mistaken for the other.
