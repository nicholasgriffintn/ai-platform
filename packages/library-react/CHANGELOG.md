## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4789c96: Let the desktop window tell the operating system when something is waiting on you.

  The web application can only surface Attention while a tab is open and, for background notifications, only through web push behind a service worker. A desktop window is already running, so it can say so directly: it polls Attention every two minutes, raises a system notification for approvals, input requests, reviews and failures it has not announced before, and puts the count of those on the application icon.

  The announcement ledger lives in the desktop's own database, keyed by account, so restarting the application does not repeat a notification and one account's items never appear for another. A backlog of more than three new items collapses into a single notification rather than a queue of them.

  Notifications are raised from Rust rather than granted to the window, so the webview gains no new capability. `library-react` gives `useWorkAttention` an optional polling interval, which the web application does not use.

- 4789c96: Announce the desktop's notifications from the task inbox the iOS application already uses, rather than a poller of its own.

  The first pass built a parallel system: it polled Work Attention, decided for itself which kinds were worth announcing, and kept its own idea of what counted as unread. Polychat already has a task notification system — a server-side inbox with read receipts, dismissal, per-item deep links and per-category preferences — and the iOS client consumes it through `TaskNotificationManager`. The desktop now consumes the same one.

  - `library-react` publishes `useTaskInbox`, the inbox query with its read and dismiss receipts. The web application had no inbox hook at all; only iOS had one, in Swift.
  - `useTaskNotificationSettings` is separated out of `useTaskNotifications`, so a surface can read the account's preferences without dragging web push registration along.
  - `polychat-schemas` publishes `taskNotificationCategoryForAttentionKind` and `isTaskNotificationCategoryEnabled`, so a client gates announcements on exactly the categories the server gates push on, rather than a hand-written list.

  What stays device-local is only what has to be: whether _this_ machine has already put a given item on screen. Announcing is not reading — a notification shown on your Mac must not mark the item read for your phone — so the ledger stays in the desktop's own database while unread, categories and the item list all come from the server.

  The badge now shows the inbox's own unread count. Desktop notifications are not clickable: `tauri-plugin-notification` exposes action handling on mobile only, so acting on an item still means opening the window.

- 505ce6a: Let the desktop window turn its own task notifications on.

  Task notification settings only knew how a browser delivers. The switch asked for browser permission, waited for a `platform: "web"` push registration against this installation, and disabled every category until one existed. The desktop window has no service worker and never registers, so the switch sat disabled, `preferences.enabled` could never become true, and the local notifications and icon badge the Rust core already knows how to raise stayed silent — even though the window polls Attention for exactly that purpose.

  How a device delivers is now a host concern. `ShellHost` carries a `useTaskNotificationChannel` hook: the web passes `useWebPushTaskNotificationChannel`, which keeps the permission, registration and retry behaviour it had, and the desktop passes `useDeviceTaskNotificationChannel`, which only flips the account preference because the running window is the delivery. The categories are shared either way and read the same server preferences through `useTaskNotificationPreferences`.

  The desktop icon badge follows the same switch, so turning task notifications off clears it rather than leaving a count behind.

- 4789c96: Give the desktop window the Teammates place, the teammate editor and the tool runner.

  Teammates was the last of the three places the shared sidebar links to that the desktop answered with a 404, and it carried the largest tail: the capability library and its dialogs, the recipe workflow controller, the connector setup dialogs and the teammate editor all lived in `apps/app`.

  They move into `component-shell` unchanged, and both hosts render the same library, the same hire, share and skill dialogs, and the same connector setup. `library-react` publishes `NEW_TEAMMATE_ID` beside `getTeammateEditorPath`, so the constant belongs with the paths that use it rather than to whichever page happened to define it.

  The desktop still answers 404 for `/chat/apps/:appId`, which needs the application runtimes rather than the capability library.

### Patch Changes

- 34380a3: Fix the defects a review of the desktop and web shells turned up.

  **The desktop window could white-screen instead of showing its error page.** `getCurrentWindow()` reads `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` synchronously, so it throws outright wherever the renderer runs without the Tauri host — `dev:renderer`, for one. The window-title effect called it on every navigation, and it ran in `DesktopShellHost`, one level _above_ the error boundary, so nothing caught it and no exception was reported. The native title is now set only when the Tauri runtime is present, and the window's own effects moved inside the boundary alongside the routes.

  **The error page trapped the window on it.** `AppErrorBoundary` never cleared its error, so "Back to the nest" changed the URL and kept rendering the same error. It now resets when the location changes.

  **A pet sheet url could resolve to an inherited property.** `resolvePetSheetUrl` looked the url up on a plain object, so an account whose sheet url was `constructor` or `toString` got a function stringified into `background-image`. It reads from a `Map` now.

  **The Work sidebar re-rendered on every streamed token in the app.** It subscribed to the whole `streams` map, which every stream mutator replaces, so each token re-ran its conversation grouping and rebuilt the sidebar. It now watches only the statuses of the conversations it lists.

  **A project conversation rebuilt its whole thread config on every render.** The `modeConfig` handed to the thread was an inline literal, and `useFileMessageAsTask` returned a fresh object each render, so `requestOptions` changed identity on every streamed chunk and tore down the chat manager's callbacks with it. Both are memoised, so the config is stable while a response streams.

  **The conversation home rebuilt its mode config needlessly, and missed an entitlement change.** `HomePage`'s host/chat merge is memoised, and `useHomeChatModeConfig` now lists `isPro`, which it reads to decide which composer commands to offer but had omitted from its dependencies.

  **The desktop rebuilt its whole place shell on every navigation.** Each page wrapped itself in `ChatPlaceShell` or `WorkPlaceShell`, so moving between two pages of the same place unmounted the sidebar and, in Work, the workspace and project context with it — where the web keeps them mounted through a layout route. A page now declares which place it belongs to and the desktop router mounts that shell once around the group.

  **Notification delivery is chosen by a component rather than a hook passed as a value.** `ShellHost` carried `useTaskNotificationChannel`, a hook stored on an object and called dynamically, which the linter flagged as unverifiable. Each host now supplies a `TaskNotificationSettings` component bound to its own channel, matching how `HostDialogs` already works.

  **The desktop announced attention on every poll.** The attention query returns a fresh array every 15 seconds, so the window sent the whole list to its Rust core each time and relied on the ledger there to stay quiet. It now skips the call when the set of waiting items has not changed, keyed by account so switching accounts still announces.

- 4789c96: Put the notification inbox on the Attention place, so every host has somewhere to act on a notification.

  Two corrections to the previous change.

  `useTaskInbox` should never have existed: `useTaskAttention` in `library-react` already ran the same query with the same read and dismiss receipts, and already polled. The desktop notifier uses it, and the duplicate is gone. It also polls on its own, so `useWorkAttention` needs no interval option either.

  The claim that the web had no inbox was wrong. It had one, on the Work overview, behind a route the desktop answers with a 404 — which is why the desktop had a badge and notifications with nowhere to go. `AttentionPage` now carries the same inbox, built from the same `TaskAttentionList` the Work overview uses, so both hosts can open, read and dismiss an item from the place their sidebar already links to.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 42c36ea: Release the applications from changesets. Merging a changeset that names an application versions it, tags it and publishes a GitHub release with its changelog entry; the desktop release also carries macOS, Windows and Linux archives built on their own runners. The API serves those archives from `/desktop/downloads` and answers the desktop updater from `/desktop/releases`, so neither the website nor the application needs to know where the builds are hosted.
- 7d3c809: Share one connected navigation shell between the web and desktop applications.

  `component-shell` is a new package holding the wiring layer that previously lived only in `apps/app`: the chat sidebar with its conversation list and menus, the product and conversation headers, the page and product shells, global search, the settings popover and the not-found page. It is the single exception to the router-, store- and client-free rule for `component-*` packages, because connecting the controlled presentation in `component-navigation` and `component-ui` to the stores and router is its whole job.

  What differs between hosts arrives through `ShellHostProvider`: the origin public share links point at, the dialogs a host owns alone, and the actions that open them. A host that has not migrated an action supplies one that throws, so a gap stays visible instead of becoming a control that quietly does nothing.

  `library-react` publishes `DISCOVER_PATH` alongside the existing place paths, and `library-client` publishes `WEB_APP_BASE_URL` so a host without a web origin can still build share links.

  `component-conversation` drops `ConversationHeader`. It was the desktop's stand-in for a real header and is replaced by the shared `ConversationProductHeader`.

- 6334297: Move the shipped render implementations into their packages and replace the placeholder interfaces.

  Host seams added so render modules stay portable:

  - `component-ui` exposes `LinkProvider`, `Link`, and `NavLink`; hosts pass resolved hrefs and supply
    their own router.
  - `library-surface` defines `SurfaceAnalytics`, and `library-react` exposes `AnalyticsProvider` and
    `useAnalytics`, so render modules report events without knowing the provider.
  - `component-content` exposes `CustomResponseViewProvider`, so tool responses that need host data
    are registered by the application and unknown names fall back to the raw JSON view.

  Render ownership:

  - `component-ui`: page shell frame and header registry, page primitives, empty and sign-in states,
    loading spinner, page skeletons, and the file uploader presentation.
  - `component-models`: the provider icon registry and `ProviderGlyph`, Artificial Analysis panel,
    model options and lists, auto-router picker, hover preview, and the controlled selector trigger
    and panel.
  - `component-navigation`: sidebar parts, settings popover, theme and more-options menus,
    conversation list and controls, storage notice, and the search dialog.
  - `component-capabilities`: capability and app cards, experience grid, capability theme helpers,
    dynamic tool form, tool configuration dialog, tool result card, and the recipe card and dialogs.
  - `component-content`: generated response views, artefact classification, actions, callout, inline
    preview, document editor, and the sandboxed artefact renderers.
  - `component-conversation`: message content, actions, tool and function messages, citations,
    reasoning, search grounding, connector approval, agent trace, composer input and menus, council
    controls, keyboard shortcuts, and the welcome screen.
  - `component-account`: account sidebar shell, agent, team, connector, and provider views, the user
    settings form, and the provider and connector credential modals.
  - `component-workspaces`: workspace and project cards, member, invitation, governance, knowledge,
    coding environment, and activity views, Work sidebar navigation, and the create/invite dialogs.
  - `component-experiences`: article, note, and podcast presentation under `/content`; canvas and
    drawing under `/media`; the Strudel player under `/music` with the runtime as an optional peer;
    training panels and forms under `/training`.

  Shared behaviour moved below the render layer:

  - `schemas`: chat modes, model selection, region variants, provider display, token formatting,
    auto-router modes, reasoning helpers, recipe presentation, article report contracts, connector
    approval parsing, and model tool configuration parsing.
  - `library-chat`: the conversation message contract plus message, artefact, agent-trace, opinion,
    branching, compaction, speech, composer-command, and tool-result helpers, each on its own subpath.
  - `utility-core` gains `generateId`, `formatBytes`, and `getErrorMessage`; `utility-react` gains
    `useFileUpload` and `containsEventTarget`.
