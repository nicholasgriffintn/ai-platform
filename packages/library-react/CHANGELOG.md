## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 42c36ea: Release the applications from changesets. Merging a changeset that names an application versions it, tags it and publishes a GitHub release with its changelog entry; the desktop release also carries macOS, Windows and Linux archives built on their own runners. The API serves those archives from `/desktop/downloads` and answers the desktop updater from `/desktop/releases`, so neither the website nor the application needs to know where the builds are hosted.
- 7d3c809: Share one connected navigation shell between the web and desktop applications.

  `component-shell` is a new package holding the wiring layer that previously lived only in `apps/app`: the chat sidebar with its conversation list and menus, the product and conversation headers, the page and product shells, global search, the settings popover and the not-found page. It is the single exception to the router-, store- and client-free rule for `component-*` packages, because connecting the controlled presentation in `component-navigation` and `component-ui` to the stores and router is its whole job.

  What differs between hosts arrives through `ShellHostProvider`: the origin public share links point at, the dialogs a host owns alone, and the actions that open them. A host that has not migrated an action supplies one that throws, so a gap stays visible instead of becoming a control that quietly does nothing.

  `library-react` publishes `DISCOVER_PATH` alongside the existing place paths, and `library-client` publishes `WEB_APP_BASE_URL` so a host without a web origin can still build share links.

  `component-conversation` drops `ConversationHeader`. It was the desktop's stand-in for a real header and is replaced by the shared `ConversationProductHeader`.

- 6334297: Move the shipped render implementations into their packages and replace the placeholder interfaces.

  Host seams added so render modules stay portable:

  - `component-ui` exposes `LinkProvider`, `Link`, and `NavLink`; hosts pass resolved hrefs and supply
    their own router.
  - `library-surface` defines `SurfaceAnalytics`, and `library-react` exposes `AnalyticsProvider` and
    `useAnalytics`, so render modules report events without knowing the provider.
  - `component-content` exposes `CustomResponseViewProvider`, so tool responses that need host data
    are registered by the application and unknown names fall back to the raw JSON view.

  Render ownership:

  - `component-ui`: page shell frame and header registry, page primitives, empty and sign-in states,
    loading spinner, page skeletons, and the file uploader presentation.
  - `component-models`: the provider icon registry and `ProviderGlyph`, Artificial Analysis panel,
    model options and lists, auto-router picker, hover preview, and the controlled selector trigger
    and panel.
  - `component-navigation`: sidebar parts, settings popover, theme and more-options menus,
    conversation list and controls, storage notice, and the search dialog.
  - `component-capabilities`: capability and app cards, experience grid, capability theme helpers,
    dynamic tool form, tool configuration dialog, tool result card, and the recipe card and dialogs.
  - `component-content`: generated response views, artefact classification, actions, callout, inline
    preview, document editor, and the sandboxed artefact renderers.
  - `component-conversation`: message content, actions, tool and function messages, citations,
    reasoning, search grounding, connector approval, agent trace, composer input and menus, council
    controls, keyboard shortcuts, and the welcome screen.
  - `component-account`: account sidebar shell, agent, team, connector, and provider views, the user
    settings form, and the provider and connector credential modals.
  - `component-workspaces`: workspace and project cards, member, invitation, governance, knowledge,
    coding environment, and activity views, Work sidebar navigation, and the create/invite dialogs.
  - `component-experiences`: article, note, and podcast presentation under `/content`; canvas and
    drawing under `/media`; the Strudel player under `/music` with the runtime as an optional peer;
    training panels and forms under `/training`.

  Shared behaviour moved below the render layer:

  - `schemas`: chat modes, model selection, region variants, provider display, token formatting,
    auto-router modes, reasoning helpers, recipe presentation, article report contracts, connector
    approval parsing, and model tool configuration parsing.
  - `library-chat`: the conversation message contract plus message, artefact, agent-trace, opinion,
    branching, compaction, speech, composer-command, and tool-result helpers, each on its own subpath.
  - `utility-core` gains `generateId`, `formatBytes`, and `getErrorMessage`; `utility-react` gains
    `useFileUpload` and `containsEventTarget`.
