Stop saving blank assistant replies. When a model finishes a step with no visible text and no tool calls, the agent loop retries the request once, then asks for a tool-free answer from what the conversation already holds, and finally writes a plain notice if both come back empty. Every attempt's usage is billed with the turn, and empty replies are logged as `empty_model_response`.
