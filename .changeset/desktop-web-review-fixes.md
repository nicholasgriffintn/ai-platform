Fix the defects a review of the desktop and web shells turned up.

**The desktop window could white-screen instead of showing its error page.** `getCurrentWindow()` reads `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` synchronously, so it throws outright wherever the renderer runs without the Tauri host — `dev:renderer`, for one. The window-title effect called it on every navigation, and it ran in `DesktopShellHost`, one level _above_ the error boundary, so nothing caught it and no exception was reported. The native title is now set only when the Tauri runtime is present, and the window's own effects moved inside the boundary alongside the routes.

**The error page trapped the window on it.** `AppErrorBoundary` never cleared its error, so "Back to the nest" changed the URL and kept rendering the same error. It now resets when the location changes.

**A pet sheet url could resolve to an inherited property.** `resolvePetSheetUrl` looked the url up on a plain object, so an account whose sheet url was `constructor` or `toString` got a function stringified into `background-image`. It reads from a `Map` now.

**The Work sidebar re-rendered on every streamed token in the app.** It subscribed to the whole `streams` map, which every stream mutator replaces, so each token re-ran its conversation grouping and rebuilt the sidebar. It now watches only the statuses of the conversations it lists.

**A project conversation rebuilt its whole thread config on every render.** The `modeConfig` handed to the thread was an inline literal, and `useFileMessageAsTask` returned a fresh object each render, so `requestOptions` changed identity on every streamed chunk and tore down the chat manager's callbacks with it. Both are memoised, so the config is stable while a response streams.

**The conversation home rebuilt its mode config needlessly, and missed an entitlement change.** `HomePage`'s host/chat merge is memoised, and `useHomeChatModeConfig` now lists `isPro`, which it reads to decide which composer commands to offer but had omitted from its dependencies.

**The desktop rebuilt its whole place shell on every navigation.** Each page wrapped itself in `ChatPlaceShell` or `WorkPlaceShell`, so moving between two pages of the same place unmounted the sidebar and, in Work, the workspace and project context with it — where the web keeps them mounted through a layout route. A page now declares which place it belongs to and the desktop router mounts that shell once around the group.

**Notification delivery is chosen by a component rather than a hook passed as a value.** `ShellHost` carried `useTaskNotificationChannel`, a hook stored on an object and called dynamically, which the linter flagged as unverifiable. Each host now supplies a `TaskNotificationSettings` component bound to its own channel, matching how `HostDialogs` already works.

**The desktop announced attention on every poll.** The attention query returns a fresh array every 15 seconds, so the window sent the whole list to its Rust core each time and relied on the ledger there to stay quiet. It now skips the call when the set of waiting items has not changed, keyed by account so switching accounts still announces.
