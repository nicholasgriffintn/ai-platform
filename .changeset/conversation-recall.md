Let the model search earlier conversations. `search_conversations` returns one excerpt per matching conversation with its title and date, scoped to the user's personal chats or, inside a project, to that project after an access check. It is on by default for signed-in chats. The unused, unescaped `MessageRepository.searchMessages` is replaced by the scoped query, and `excerptAround` joins the shared string helpers.
