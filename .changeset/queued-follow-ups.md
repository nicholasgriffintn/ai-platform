Queue follow-ups while a Chat reply is running. The composer stays open during a reply and queues what you type, up to ten messages per conversation, listed above the composer and removable. Queued messages are held as suspended `queued_chat_message` tasks and the next one is released when the run ends, so they send in order even after the tab closes. Work keeps steering the run instead.
