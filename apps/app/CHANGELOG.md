## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a427dd: Discover is now the first thing you see. Open Polychat and the day's edition sits on the left while the right pane is ready for any question, to any model. The separate New chat button is gone: a question asked from Discover becomes a conversation in Chat, and opening a card or a listen takes over the right pane as before. On a phone, the edition comes first and an Ask bar at the bottom opens the composer. The Polychat wordmark and the new chat shortcut both lead to Discover.

  The Perch and Your week keep playing when you leave the page. A small player follows you to the bottom of the window with play, pause and a way back to the full stage, and the stage's address (such as `/?play=perch`) can be shared or bookmarked.

  Anyone without an edition of their own, including before signing in, sees Polychat's house edition: where to start, with each starter card on its own cover, what is new in the latest releases, and a weekly reading routine worth setting up. Signed in with Discover off, the same edition appears with a one-tap way to turn Discover on.

  New accounts start with a Getting started notebook that explains Chat, Teammates, Notebooks, Discover, Work and your keys. Discover also refreshes a little more quietly: live updates say which edition revision changed, so a page already showing it does not reload.

### Patch Changes

- 8642a45: Discover recordings, episodes and wind-down voices now play at a steady, clearly audible level. Spoken audio is levelled as it plays, so a recording that used to start quiet or drift quieter as it went on holds its volume to the end. New recordings are also voiced in shorter runs so the voice stays even across a whole read.

### Minor Changes

- f9945b6: Choose the models Polychat uses behind the scenes. Profile → Model choices lists every background job, from titling and compaction to dictation, document reading, pictures and voice, and lets you pick a first choice plus fallbacks from the models your account can run. Fallbacks also step in when a model fails mid-job. Workspace owners and admins can set the same choices for a whole workspace under Models → Model choices, and those apply to its projects ahead of each member's own.

  Anything you leave alone runs on the platform defaults, which are now Workers AI models throughout. Discover, notebook studio drafts, podcast scripts and framing use the new Writing job instead of a chat tier. Sketches are now repainted with FLUX.2 [klein], and Gemma 4 can read images for Documents. When a model you picked is retired or no longer available to you, Waiting on you flags it and the job runs on your next choice until you replace it. Your previous transcription setting carries over as your Dictation choice.

  "Fill these in for me" ranks the models you can run for each job by the benchmark that suits it, optionally keeping to one provider you've connected, and shows the picks before you apply them. Documents now offers Mistral OCR, and GreenPT adds Metis for decisions and guardrails alongside DeepSeek V4.1 Flash 1017 and MiniMax M3. The Models page shows what actually runs for you for each background job.

  Model choices is now the one place for every model setting. Your default tier, default model and sandbox coding model moved there from Customise Chat, and are picked from the models you can run rather than typed in. The speech provider and model now come from the Voice job, and Customise Chat keeps the voice and expressiveness for whichever voice model is active. A speech model you had chosen carries over as your Voice choice. The Guardrails job now offers Llama Guard, TypeSafe's Jev and Mistral moderation, and the model you pick decides which checks run. Bedrock and Shieldstral stay as separate guardrail services in Customise Chat, and a previous TypeSafe or Mistral setting carries over as your Guardrails choice.

### Patch Changes

- f6c165f: Teammates hear about red builds and requested changes. Once a teammate links the pull request it opened with `link_pull_request`, a failing CI run or a "changes requested" review on it sends the task back to that teammate with the failing checks or the review to fix, and passing CI is noted on the task. When a teammate reviewer asks for changes, its notes now go straight into the owner's next run. You can give a task both a builder and a reviewer, such as QA: set the reviewer when you create the task or from its page, and they are woken as soon as the builder's work is ready. Publishing a Polychat pull request review can also send its findings back to the task that opened the pull request.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 766145d: Live sessions now support push to talk. Turn it on with the hand button next to the microphone, then hold the microphone button or Space to speak and let go to hand the turn over. The microphone stays closed between turns, so background noise no longer interrupts replies. The setting is remembered across Live in chat and with teammates.
- afe0236: Notes, Article Processor and Paperwork now live in Files instead of in their own apps.

  - **Notes write where they live.** The Note tile in Files opens a blank note straight in the editor that the Note Taker app used to have: sepia or plain, your font and size, dictation, tab audio, notes from a recording link and AI assist. Every note opens ready to edit, including notes Poly saves for you and notes in notebooks. A blank note you close without writing is thrown away.
  - **Note details are still there.** Metadata on a note shows its summary, topics, tags, type, sentiment and where it was captured from, plus word count and reading time. You can edit the details, or regenerate the summary. Details from your old notes come across with them.
  - **Reading settings in one place.** The Aa button sets the typeface, sepia or app-matching paper and a text size from 12 to 40px. It applies to every note you open.
  - **Quicker panels.** File info, Knowledge, and Reading or Framing (where they apply) have their own buttons beside Ask in the file viewer.
  - **Version history and comments on notes.** Each editing session keeps a version you can read and bring back from Version history. Notes take comments and threads like documents do, and in a project you can mention a teammate to pick one up.
  - **Safe across tabs.** If a note changes somewhere else while you are typing, Files tells you and lets you keep your edits or use the saved version.
  - **How it's framed, for anything you file.** Links and pasted text in Files can be checked for slant, tone, sourcing, loaded wording and what they leave out. This is the same check Discover uses. Ask Poly to analyse an article and it files the piece and reads its framing in one go.
  - **Make a report from a folder.** A folder's menu has Make a report, which writes a briefing, study guide, FAQ or post from the folder's files. The report lands in the folder as a document you can edit.
  - **Read as receipt, invoice or damage claim.** Any photo, PDF or text in Files can be read as a receipt, invoice or damage claim. Doubtful figures are flagged and the source text is highlighted where each value came from.
  - **Folders that read their own paperwork.** Set a folder's Read files as option and every file already in it, and every file added later, is read automatically, including files from connected syncs. The folder then shows a ledger with a running total, an Export CSV button and Save as sheet.
  - Your existing notes and article reports have moved into Files. Each article session becomes a folder holding its articles and its report. The Note Taker, Article Processor and Paperwork apps are gone from Apps.

- 810eff4: Work now runs on tasks instead of chats. Teammates manage the work between them: they assign each other, ask for review, escalate, raise cases and propose hires.

  - **Projects open on their tasks.** Each task has a key such as BIL-41, an owner, a priority, a due date and a thread. Switch between List, Board, Tree, Timeline and Triage views. Type a request into the box at the top and the project's lead routes it. Your old project conversations are now done tasks, with their history kept.
  - **One memory per workspace.** A teammate employed in a workspace keeps one working memory and one set of connection grants across all its projects, carried over from what it already knew in each project.
  - **Tasks run where their owner runs.** A task follows its teammate's model onto Polychat, the sandbox or one of your machines. If that place can't take it, such as a machine that's offline, a sandbox with no repository or a provider that isn't ready, the task waits and says why instead of failing part way. Machine tasks start by themselves when the machine checks in.
  - **Big tasks split into sub-tasks.** A teammate proposes how to break its task down, with owners and the order things must happen in. Once its manager or you accept that revision, the sub-tasks are created with their blockers and the ready ones start.
  - **Teammates hand work to each other.** A teammate can split a task into sub-tasks, assign them to other teammates, ask someone to review, block a task on the person who can unblock it, and escalate up its reporting line. Everything it does runs on the authority of the person responsible for it.
  - **The lead handles the team's questions first.** When a teammate gets stuck on a question or a failed run, its manager looks at it before you do. It answers what it can from the mission, the plan and earlier answers, sends work back to run again, and only comes to you with one combined request for what it genuinely can't know. Approvals and spending still come straight to you.
  - **Mention a teammate to wake it.** Write @name in a task thread and that teammate picks the task up. Teammates also wake when they're assigned work, asked to review or unblocked, and on their own heartbeat if you give them one.
  - **Team page.** See who reports to whom, where each teammate runs, how often it wakes and what it has spent this month. Heartbeat rails show when each teammate ran, what it is running now and where it got stuck.
  - **Budgets that brake.** Give each teammate a monthly budget. Inbox warns you at 80%, and at 100% the teammate pauses until you raise its cap.
  - **Hiring by proposal.** You or a teammate can propose a hire with a reason, a manager and a budget. Owners and admins approve or reject it in Inbox.
  - **Cases.** Problems found by people, by teammates or in imported issues land in a project's Triage, linked to the tasks that fix them. A case closes itself when those tasks are done.
  - **Channels and email can open cases.** Connect a Slack channel, Telegram chat or email address to a project and choose "Open a case in Triage". Each new thread becomes a case that records who wrote in, and follow-ups in the same thread join it. The teammate drafts a reply, and you read, edit and send it from the case.
  - **Standups.** Turn on a standup in project settings and pick the days, time and questions. Each standup is a task: you answer in Inbox from a draft built from your own activity, teammates answer from theirs, and the lead posts a summary, which can also go to a connected channel. Skip a day with one click, or pause standups until a date for holidays.
  - **Initiatives.** Set your workspace's mission and initiatives, link projects to them and watch progress add up from their tasks. Teammates see why their work matters when they run. The lead reviews the initiatives every week and can write you a daily brief, on the days and times you choose on its page.
  - **One Inbox.** Hires, budget warnings, standups, escalations, setup plans, approvals, teammates waiting on you and tasks handed to you sit in a single list, newest decisions first. Cases stay in Triage. My tasks lists everything you own or are responsible for across workspaces.
  - **Find tasks with ⌘K.** Search now finds tasks by key, such as BIL-41, or by what they're about.
  - **Unstick a task.** If a queued or running task stops moving, open it and choose "Send to the queue again" from its menu.
  - **Costs and Activity.** Each workspace shows spend by teammate, initiative, project and task for the period you pick, and a feed of everything people and teammates did. Usage and the audit log moved here from settings.
  - **Setup works with what you've connected.** The setup plan only uses services you've already connected, and gives each project read or read-and-write access as it needs. Anything else the lead thinks would help is listed as a suggestion you can connect in Plugins, never a task.
  - **New workspace starts with a lead.** Give the workspace a name, a mission, links the lead can read and a monthly budget. The lead proposes a setup plan covering projects, team, budgets, wake rules, standups and first tasks, and nothing starts until you approve it. If anything fails while the plan is applied, nothing it made is kept and the plan shows why. Existing workspaces can hire a lead from the Team page. Edit the plan yourself before approving it, or save a running team as a template and start the next workspace from it.
  - **Inbox on iPhone.** Approve hires and setup plans and answer standups from Inbox on iOS.

### Patch Changes

- 12ac959: YouTube links are now read from the video's timestamped transcript instead of the page around it, and the video plays right in the chat. Videos without captions are no longer padded out with page clutter: the assistant says it couldn't read them and still shows the video.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 11dabe3: See how the news is framed before you trust it.

  - **How it's framed.** A Discover read has a How it's framed button. It shows the article's slant and tone, who it relies on, any loaded wording (quoted exactly as written) and what it leaves out, plus a writing grade. It is kept with the article, so opening it again costs nothing.
  - **Compare the coverage.** A Discover topic with two or more articles that day can compare them: what every outlet agrees on, each outlet's angle, where they differ and what none of them mention. The comparison is filed in your Discover notebook.
  - **Article analysis speaks the same language.** Article analysis in Apps now uses the same framing check, so its reports describe framing and omissions rather than labelling pieces left or right.
  - Both count towards your monthly Discover budget and stop when it is spent.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 187afde: Discover gathers before it writes, and Poly reads your own services without asking.

  - **A Discover notebook.** Before each morning Poly reads your connected services and researches every topic you follow into a notebook called Discover: one document per service and a dated research document per topic. The morning edition is written from those documents, so a slow or broken service never stops the edition. Open the notebook to see what Discover knows.
  - **Every connected service counts.** Discover now picks from the whole connector catalogue by what you have connected: Last.fm, Readwise, Hardcover, Audiobookshelf, Trakt, Marquee, YouTube, Raindrop, DEV, Oura, Google Calendar or Outlook, Gmail or Outlook newsletters, Google Tasks, Todoist or TickTick, Linear, GitHub, Fathom, WakaTime, OpenWeather, Google Photos, NASA and Artificial Analysis. Where two services cover the same thing, the first connected one is used. Each service shows when it was last read, or why it could not be, in Discover settings, where you can also set where you are for weather.
  - **Marquee.** Connect [Marquee](https://marquee.pashi.app) with an API token under Plugins. Poly can read your shelf, what is on tonight and the week ahead, search the catalogue, and, with your approval, save to your shelf or follow a name.
  - **No more approvals for reading your own accounts.** Poly, in your personal space, reads your connected accounts without a separate grant or an approval. Scheduled runs never create approvals; an operation that would need one is left out with a note instead of stalling the run.
  - **Last.fm and Trakt remember who you are.** Both connectors now take your username alongside the key, so Discover and Poly no longer have to ask.
  - **Interests are researched overnight.** Discover works out three to five interests from what you have been doing, favouring what you do outside Polychat over chats about it, and researches each one before the morning, so every interest has fresh reading on day one.
  - **More kinds of card.** Episodes airing, releases and gigs appear under Coming up; videos and podcast episodes under Watching and listening; newsletters worth a minute under Reading with the sender named. Each opens a chat with the right first step, such as adding an event to your calendar.
  - **An evening edition.** Turn it on in Discover settings for a second, shorter edition at 19:00 that looks at tomorrow. It never makes an episode or a Perch.
  - **Poly knows your week.** Poly's own thread and its daily look around read what Discover gathered, so Poly can be specific about what you have been listening to, reading and watching without re-reading your services.
  - **File things in a notebook from anywhere.** Ask Poly to put a page, a note or some files in a notebook by name, and it will, creating the notebook only when you ask.
  - **Send Studio work on.** A finished report, deck or table in a notebook's Studio has a Send menu for Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets and DEV when they are connected. Each send runs through the notebook chat and asks before it writes.
  - **Marquee records what you watch.** Tell Poly what you watched, are watching or want to see, with a rating and your thoughts, and it saves that to your Marquee shelf after you approve. Connectors without live discovery, such as Marquee, Last.fm and Trakt, now tell Poly their operations and fields instead of failing.
  - **A real feed.** Discover now reads the day's headlines for where you are and, when Reddit is connected, the best posts from your communities. Every interest is researched from the news of the last three days, with the publisher and date kept. Poly's picks lead the edition, and up to three stories per interest and from Reddit fill the Reading section beneath them, never repeating a link you have already seen. Your recent chats only shape the edition when nothing else is known about you yet.
  - **Discover reads the articles, not just the headlines.** Each page the overnight research finds is read in full and filed in the Discover notebook, and the edition is written from what the pages actually say, in plain prose rather than page markup. Opening a read card talks to the filed article, so Poly can give you the gist or the other side without fetching anything, and cards show the site's icon. Newsletters and Reddit posts carry their text too, so a card can tell you what happened rather than that something did.
  - **The Perch and Your week talk about the things, not about their notes.** The round-up now has the full text of the articles behind the day's reading and spends its time on what they report; Your week is built from what your documents, notebooks and chats actually contain, so it can say what you worked out rather than what it was not told.
  - **Episodes finish.** Chapters are now written and voiced one after another instead of all at once, so a later chapter no longer loses its save to an earlier one and sits on Queued. Your week shows its cover on the shelf and sits beside The Perch.
  - **Episode chapters say what they are about.** The chapter list shows what each chapter covers rather than the illustrator's notes, and Your week leaves out generated files it cannot describe.
  - **An edition is never lost to one bad link.** A page the feed cannot show as a card, such as a plain http address, is left out rather than making the whole edition unreadable, and an edition is checked before it is saved so a problem names the exact card.
  - **Failures say why.** A service that answers with an error, including a rate limit, is recorded as a failed read with the reason, and a connector that cannot be reached says what went wrong.
  - **Discover documents explain themselves.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook now reads as a page: when it was read and what was found. A service that could not be read says why. YouTube is read as your subscriptions and recent likes rather than your own uploads.
  - **Fixes.** The first edition after enabling Discover now gathers from your services before it is written, instead of being composed from recent chat titles alone. The Perch's captions follow the audio instead of jumping to the end, and loading a skill with a leading slash in its path no longer fails.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b2929f: Confirm your date of birth before your first message.

  - **Asked once, at the right moment.** The first time you send a message, signed in or not, on the web, desktop or iPhone, Polychat asks for your date of birth. It keeps only whether you meet the minimum age of 18, never the date, and the answer can't be changed later.
  - **Skip if you're just looking.** Skip the question and you can keep browsing, but you can't send messages until you answer it. Polychat asks again the next time you try to send one.
  - **Why we ask.** A new page at `/age-check` explains why we ask, what we keep and your rights in the UK and EU. The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy now say plainly that Polychat is for people aged 18 or over.
  - **Same rule on the API.** Creating a response, sending input to one and calling chat completions all return 403 until the age check is done, for API keys and anonymous sessions alike. Read or record it with `GET` and `POST /auth/age`.
  - **Self-hosting.** Set `AGE_GATE_ENABLED` to `false` in your Worker vars to turn the check off completely.

- 91c7d3d: Choose what Polychat can reach for on its own.

  - **Capabilities settings.** A new Capabilities section in Customise Chat has switches for web search and for documents and connected apps. Turn one off and Polychat stops using it by itself, including deep research for web search. Tools you pick in the composer, or that a project, teammate or recipe sets up, still work.
  - **Chat history means chat history.** Searching your earlier chats now follows the chat history switch in Memories. Turn it on if you want Polychat to look back through your previous conversations.

- 1fe4222: Discover gathers before it writes, and Poly reads your own services without asking.

  - **A Discover notebook.** Before each morning Poly reads your connected services and researches every topic you follow into a notebook called Discover: one document per service and a dated research document per topic. The morning edition is written from those documents, so a slow or broken service never stops the edition. Open the notebook to see what Discover knows.
  - **Every connected service counts.** Discover now picks from the whole connector catalogue by what you have connected: Last.fm, Readwise, Hardcover, Audiobookshelf, Trakt, Marquee, YouTube, Raindrop, DEV, Oura, Google Calendar or Outlook, Gmail or Outlook newsletters, Google Tasks, Todoist or TickTick, Linear, GitHub, Fathom, WakaTime, OpenWeather, Google Photos, NASA and Artificial Analysis. Where two services cover the same thing, the first connected one is used. Each service shows when it was last read, or why it could not be, in Discover settings, where you can also set where you are for weather.
  - **Marquee.** Connect [Marquee](https://marquee.pashi.app) with an API token under Plugins. Poly can read your shelf, what is on tonight and the week ahead, search the catalogue, and, with your approval, save to your shelf or follow a name.
  - **No more approvals for reading your own accounts.** Poly, in your personal space, reads your connected accounts without a separate grant or an approval. Scheduled runs never create approvals; an operation that would need one is left out with a note instead of stalling the run.
  - **Last.fm and Trakt remember who you are.** Both connectors now take your username alongside the key, so Discover and Poly no longer have to ask.
  - **Interests are researched overnight.** Discover works out three to five interests from what you have been doing, favouring what you do outside Polychat over chats about it, and researches each one before the morning, so every interest has fresh reading on day one.
  - **More kinds of card.** Episodes airing, releases and gigs appear under Coming up; videos and podcast episodes under Watching and listening; newsletters worth a minute under Reading with the sender named. Each opens a chat with the right first step, such as adding an event to your calendar.
  - **An evening edition.** Turn it on in Discover settings for a second, shorter edition at 19:00 that looks at tomorrow. It never makes an episode or a Perch.
  - **Poly knows your week.** Poly's own thread and its daily look around read what Discover gathered, so Poly can be specific about what you have been listening to, reading and watching without re-reading your services.
  - **File things in a notebook from anywhere.** Ask Poly to put a page, a note or some files in a notebook by name, and it will, creating the notebook only when you ask.
  - **Send Studio work on.** A finished report, deck or table in a notebook's Studio has a Send menu for Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets and DEV when they are connected. Each send runs through the notebook chat and asks before it writes.
  - **Marquee records what you watch.** Tell Poly what you watched, are watching or want to see, with a rating and your thoughts, and it saves that to your Marquee shelf after you approve. Connectors without live discovery, such as Marquee, Last.fm and Trakt, now tell Poly their operations and fields instead of failing.
  - **A real feed.** Discover now reads the day's headlines for where you are, the front page of Hacker News, and, when Reddit is connected, the best posts from your communities. Every interest is researched from the news of the last three days, with the publisher and date kept. Poly's picks lead the edition, and up to three stories per interest, Reddit and Hacker News fill the Reading section beneath them, never repeating a link you have already seen. Your recent chats only shape the edition when nothing else is known about you yet.
  - **Discover documents explain themselves.** Each service's document in the Discover notebook now reads as a page: when it was read, what was found, and the raw result underneath. A service that could not be read says why. YouTube is read as your subscriptions and recent likes rather than your own uploads.
  - **Fixes.** The first edition after enabling Discover now gathers from your services before it is written, instead of being composed from recent chat titles alone. The Perch's captions follow the audio instead of jumping to the end, and loading a skill with a leading slash in its path no longer fails.

- 06c02dd: Discover is your morning edition from Poly. Open Discover in the Chat sidebar, turn it on, and each morning Poly leaves a brief, painted topic tiles, reading, automations worth setting up and the odd check-in, built from what you've been talking about.

  - Pick any card to open it beside the feed with its own conversation, then tell Discover more, less or never. Follow a topic and it gets a notebook that collects each day's best links.
  - The Perch is a short two-host round-up of each edition, in your podcast show and its private feed.
  - Today's episode is a narrated, illustrated part of a five-day season on your top topic, with chapters, camera moves and a listen-only mode. Save a season as one long listen for your podcast app.
  - Wind down makes a five, ten or twenty minute breathing, body-scan or unwind session for the evening. It starts speaking within seconds, over quiet music made for the session that you can turn off.
  - Today's episode, The Perch and Wind down share one player beside the feed, and keep playing while you read other cards.
  - Connect Readwise, Last.fm, Trakt, Hardcover or Podcast Index, and Discover reads what you're reading, listening to and watching. Notebooks can now keep connected sources up to date.
  - From before cards bring back flashcards you missed, links you saved a while ago and what you were doing a year ago.
  - On Sundays, Your week is a short private recap of what you made, learned and finished.
  - Turn on Tell me when it's ready and Poly lets you know on your phone and connected channels when the edition lands.
  - Settings lists your connected services, each with its own switch for Discover. Oura and Audiobookshelf can now be connected too, and on iPhone Discover can use yesterday's Apple Health summary for the brief.
  - Health, sexuality, religion, politics and money only appear when you follow them or ask. Episodes and their quizzes and flashcards land in a followed topic's notebook, and episodes open in Files with the same player.
  - Audio and video across chat, Files and notebooks now use one player.
  - The product tour now lives at /tour. On iOS, Discover is in the menu and there is a Today widget.
  - Long structured generations no longer give up after 100 seconds, so episodes and other background work finish instead of failing part way.
  - Podcasts and episodes now show their real length and jump to the right place when you scrub or resume.
  - Background work interrupted part way, by a deploy or a crash, now picks up again instead of sitting unfinished.

- abf8eb7: A rebuilt iPhone app, and approvals that go back together.

  - **Four tabs on iPhone.** Home shows your Discover edition, morning or evening, with the brief, topics, links and the episode, The Perch, your week and wind down, each with its real status and artwork. Chats has a Chat and Work toggle for your own conversations and your projects. Attention gathers approvals, questions, reviews, your inbox and background tasks, with a badge on the app icon. Settings covers your account, default model, Discover, Apple Health and notifications.
  - **Replies stream properly on iPhone.** Text arrives as it is written, each step of a reply that uses tools shows in order, chats open at the latest message, and headings, lists, quotes, code and tables render the way they do on the web.
  - **iPhone keeps up with your other devices.** Conversations, running work and Attention update live when something changes on the web or desktop.
  - **Widgets show what's happening.** The Today, Attention and Poly widgets come in small, medium and large sizes and on the Lock Screen, with the latest edition, what's waiting on you and what Poly is working on.
  - **Approvals arrive as one set.** When Poly asks for several approvals at once, decide each one (or approve or reject the rest in one go) and Polychat sends every decision together once the set is complete, so Poly carries on with all of them rather than one at a time. This works on the web, desktop and iPhone.
  - **Voice and Apple Health from iPhone.** Dictation and the Apple Health switch work again from the app.

- 8b965f6: Conversation groups are now notebooks. Click a notebook's name in the sidebar to open it: your sources on the left, the chat in the middle and Studio on the right. Every chat in a notebook answers from the sources you tick, names the source behind each claim, and can search the notebook's earlier chats too.

  - Add sources from Files, uploads, web pages or pasted text, or search the web from the notebook. Fast research finds pages to pick from; deep research writes a report in the background and brings back the pages it cites.
  - Studio makes audio overviews, slide decks, video overviews, mind maps, reports, flashcards, quizzes, infographics and data tables from the ticked sources. The pencil on each tile lets you choose the format, length, style, language and focus.
  - Flashcards and quizzes remember how you got on. Click any topic in a mind map to ask about it.
  - Save any reply as a note, and turn a note into a source when you want chats to read it.
  - Configure a notebook to answer as a learning guide or a persona of your own, at the length you like, from its sources only or with the web as well.

- 0a57f73: Open any file and ask about it.

  - **One viewer for every file.** Documents, sources, recordings, images and memories all open in the same viewer. The title menu holds file info, version history, share links and every conversation about the file. Files opened from a chat, a run or a task open on top of where you were.
  - **Ask about this file.** The viewer has its own conversation. Polychat reads the file fresh on every turn, can revise a document as a new revision you can restore, and keeps the conversation with the file so you can pick it up later.
  - **Poly knows the page you are on.** Each place has a guide Poly reads whenever you ask it something there, and a fresh Poly conversation opens with that guide and a few starters. Your first chat opens with the guide to conversations.
  - **API.** Pass `conversation.subject` with `{ type, id }` when creating a response to start a conversation about a source, output or memory, and list them with `GET /conversations?subject_type=&subject_id=`. `GET /skills/guides` returns each place's guide.

- 11381a9: Teammates are now people you message, not settings you edit.

  - **Teammate threads.** Opening a teammate opens its own conversation, which carries on between visits. The sidebar lists the teammates you are talking to and your groups, newest activity first, with anyone who needs you at the top. Those conversations no longer also appear in the chat list. The conversation uses the same workspace as any other chat, and its side panel sums up the teammate: what it is doing, its autonomy, and how many routines and connections it has, each a click from Working context.
  - **Groups.** Use "Add a teammate" on a teammate's page to put two to six teammates in one conversation. Use @name, or tap a name in the header, to choose who answers. Every reply shows which teammate wrote it, and messages teammates send back while they work collapse into one "Messages from…" line you can open.
  - **Reactions.** React to a reply from the smiley button, or long-press on iOS. 👍 and 👎 also tell the teammate how it did, and teammates react 👀 to your message when they pick it up instead of replying "On it". A reaction never approves anything.
  - **Receipts.** When a tool sends, books, pays, deletes or changes something, the conversation shows a short receipt such as "Created routine · Friday inbox tidy · every Friday at 09:00", with the full output one click away.
  - **Live with teammates.** Live now works in teammate and group conversations. Start it from the Live button and stop it from the same place; each spoken turn goes to the teammate with its tools, and anything it wants to do still waits for your approval.
  - **Slack and Telegram signals.** Connected channels react 👀 when a message is picked up, show a working status in Slack threads and swap to ⚠️ if the run fails. Choose "Also ✅ when it is done" or "No reactions" when you connect a channel.
  - **More teammates to hire.** New jobs for personal admin, productivity, sales and marketing, operations and engineering, including Inbox tidy, Trip watcher, Morning brief, Meeting prep, Bug reproduction and Expense manager. Each arrives with its own character and offers to set up its routine.
  - **Dry runs.** Run any set-up routine as a dry run. Anything that would send, write, spend or delete returns a draft instead, so you can check a routine before it goes live.
  - **Batch review.** When three or more approvals are waiting, tick the ones you want and approve them together. Each is still approved on its own, exactly as listed.

- 91c7d3d: Choose how the assistant responds without writing a prompt.

  - **Style controls.** Personalised responses now has dropdowns for base style and tone (Professional, Friendly, Candid, Quirky, Efficient, Nerdy or Cynical), warmth, enthusiasm, emoji, and headers and lists. Leave any on Default to keep the assistant's usual behaviour.
  - **Custom instructions on top.** Your own traits and preferences sit below the controls and are added to the style you pick, so you can choose a tone and still add anything the controls do not cover. Instructions you have already written carry on working unchanged.

- 7b36da1: Sources is now where your media lives. Files' Given tab is renamed Sources and gains Podcasts, Image Studio and Replicate alongside the library.

  - Upload images, audio and video straight into Sources. Open any audio or video source to play it, transcribe it, write notes with decisions and action items, and make cover art. The transcript becomes searchable, so recordings work as grounding like any other source. This replaces the Recording Processor app.
  - Image Studio, sketch-to-painting and Replicate runs now save what they make into Sources, where it can be reused as material. They have moved out of Apps and the Canvas sidebar item into Files › Sources.
  - Make podcasts from your sources: pick sources, a format (deep dive, brief, debate or critique) and a length, and two hosts talk it through. Each episode lands in Sources with its audio, transcript, show notes and cover.
  - Group episodes into shows and create a private RSS feed link to subscribe in any podcast app. Making a new link turns off the old one.
  - Ask Poly or a teammate to make an episode with the new podcast tool, or install the Podcast Briefing recipe to get a fresh episode on your topics or Sources on a schedule.

- d7716ff: Polychat on Apple Watch and Apple TV, and notifications you can act on.

  - **Approve from the notification.** Task approvals arrive with Approve and Decline buttons, single questions take a typed or dictated answer, and Poly's updates take a reply, all without opening the app. They work on the Lock Screen and on Apple Watch, and approvals and questions break through Focus as time-sensitive.
  - **Poly on your wrist.** The Apple Watch app lists what needs you and what Poly is working on, approves or declines tasks and runs, answers single questions, and asks Poly anything by dictation, with the answer read aloud if you like. Sign in with one tap from a nearby iPhone, or with a code at polychat.app/device.
  - **Complications.** Put a count of what needs you, or Poly's status and next item, on any watch face. The Poly Live Activity also shows in the watch's Smart Stack.
  - **Wind down on the watch.** Play today's Discover wind down, or record a new breathing, body scan or unwind session, through AirPods with each step on screen and a tap on the wrist as it moves on. Time spent listening is saved to Apple Health as mindful minutes.
  - **Discover on Apple TV.** Today's edition, the episode with its pictures and captions full screen, wind down and every card, with the day's picks on the Top Shelf. Sign in by scanning a code with your phone. An Apple TV gets a Discover-only key, so your chats, projects and files stay out of reach, and you can revoke it from Profile.
  - **AirPlay episodes.** Episodes and wind downs show in Now Playing on the Lock Screen, Control Center and Apple Watch. Send them to an Apple TV with the AirPlay button and the current picture comes along, or mirror your screen for the full picture with captions.

### Patch Changes

- a9f7c20: Every page now sits in the same frame.

  - **Titles in the header.** Tool, skill, invitation and app pages show their name in the top bar instead of "Chat" or "Work", with the same spacing as the rest of the app.
  - **One header for project teammates.** Opening a teammate inside a project no longer stacks a "Work" bar above the teammate's own header.
  - **Tidier errors.** When a workspace, project or task list fails to load, or needs you to sign in, the message appears inside the page with its title rather than floating on its own.
  - **Shared links.** Shared conversations and outputs show their title while loading.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bec25b: Add Polychat Benchmarks: GeoGuess, Countdown, Fermi Bets, Long Odds, Hamster Wheel and Strudel Groove, run on one engine for official, personal and workspace scopes. Results at `/benchmarks` show intervals, Artificial Analysis indexes with attribution, measured cost and a medal table, people can play the auto-scored benchmarks and vote on blind pairs, the Benchmarks app runs them against your own models and keys, and the model selector previews each model's standings.
- 65fbf81: Add the newest live models. Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live runs transcription sessions (so Notes dictation can use Gemini) and Gemini 3.5 Live Translate runs translation sessions, both through the existing Live API token flow. GPT-Live 1 joins the OpenAI realtime models as a server-brokered WebRTC call with Responses delegation, so the browser never holds a project key.
- 65fbf81: Refresh the realtime providers and Note Taker. Notes dictation now runs on the shared live session with any ready transcription provider and commits OpenAI turns on silence. Gemini Live defaults to Gemini 3.8 Live, OpenAI transcription sends the `languages` field and drops the retired Whisper and GPT-4o models, translation sessions use the dedicated translations endpoints, and proxied transcription sessions settle billing on their measured audio instead of a flat reservation. The proxy audio cap now covers the full session length, Notes lists return excerpts with server-side search, metadata is only described once a note has enough text, and the unused video analysis options are gone.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d3f1df3: Canvas is a place, not a mode toggle. Chat and Work sidebars link to it above Files; opening it in Work asks for a project first, like a new chat, and keeps what it makes with that project.
- 5ead2cc: Import GitHub and Linear issues into Work and review exact GitHub PR revisions manually or through signed automatic intake. Retain captured Sources and review Outputs, isolate each workspace and credential owner, and approve publication separately.

  Apply migration `0061_project_task_integrations` before deployment. Configure the GitHub webhook secret and pull-request events for automatic intake, and pull-request write permission for publication.

- c126d04: Add model governance to Work. Workspaces can search Hugging Face, import models and datasets pinned to a commit, and review static inspection evidence that never loads the weights. Approvals follow versioned policies with dry runs, exceptions and expiry. Suites can be compared across serving routes with confidence intervals, and fine-tunes run on Hugging Face Jobs from governed conversation snapshots with lineage and a compute record. Approved versions can be served on dedicated Inference Endpoints, drift is caught by nightly replays, and any route or version exports as a CycloneDX ML-BOM. Workspaces can enforce approved routes in project chats, and generations carry route and version tags. Each workspace connects its own Hugging Face account or organisation under Govern, with the platform token as an optional default, and retiring a deployed route deletes its endpoint. Training moves from Profile to Models › Build, and Hub staging for Bedrock imports is keyed by commit.
- 90f7110: Turn Work › Models into a model platform on the workspace's own provider accounts. Connect Hugging Face, AWS, Together, Fireworks, Nebius, Google Vertex, Azure AI Foundry, RunPod, Cloudflare Workers AI or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, then upload weights or register them from a bucket, build governed datasets from files, the Hub, buckets, rated conversations or a teacher model, and train with supervised, preference, reinforcement, distillation, embedding, merge or quantise runs after comparing trainers on fit and cost. Deployments are sized and priced per host, serve through aliases with eval gates, canaries and rollback, and appear in chat as models. Governance adds per-action permissions with separation of duties, budgets with spend approval, idle pause, revocation across lineage, erasure requests, an audit trail and CycloneDX, SPDX, model card and training content exports.

  The personal Training app, the training Worker and `component-experiences/training` are removed, and the API now mounts the platform under `/model-platform`.

- 169e2f5: Add the Polychat CLI, which pairs a terminal, server or gateway through a device code instead of a pasted API key, and show it on the downloads page. The device approval page now shows the code as cells, the requesting client, its expiry and what approval grants. Device sign-in clients no longer trip bot detection when they start and poll.
- 6966643: Grant selected actions from existing connectors directly to projects through Plugins, without creating a recipe. Reuse personal accounts, the connector catalogue, project capabilities and existing execution approvals. Preserve exclusions and narrower recipe permissions.
- d3f1df3: Automations leave the teammates library for their own Scheduled place. The Chat and Work sidebars link to it under Teammates, and the recipe cards, filters, schedule dialogs and deep links move with it.
- 57f8a16: Add Sites, a generative site builder that works from one brief. Jev classifies the brief into a plan (kind, scope, tone, palette, model tier), a tier-selected coding model streams the site as JSON Patch lines against a guardrailed component catalogue, and the shell renders every patch the moment it lands. `library-sites` holds the catalogue, patch stream compiler, validator and repair, prompt assembly, theme tokens and a deterministic Next.js and Tailwind code generator; `component-sites` holds the live React registry, themed preview and code view. Sites persist as revisioned outputs, refine in follow-ups, export as runnable project files, and hand off to a project's sandbox for a full build. The SSE buffer parser now lives once in `utility-core`. Sites are interactive (state, bindings, visibility, repeat, filters and actions in both the live renderer and the generated code), editable in place through an element inspector with zero-token edits and scoped refinement, exportable straight to a pull request with generated images, embeddable in chat through the `build_site` tool, revisioned with restore and public preview links, and judged by Jev at planning, refinement, quality-scoring and prompt-evaluation time.

### Patch Changes

- ac1b6d6: Replace browser pop-ups with in-app dialogs and toasts, and stop Attention showing Chat users a Work sales page.

  - Renaming a conversation in the Chat or Work sidebar opens a shared `RenameConversationDialog` instead of `window.prompt`, and rename, upload and history-export failures show a toast instead of `window.alert`.
  - Attention shows everyone signed in their background tasks. Workspace attention and the task inbox stay Pro-only, and non-Pro users see a short note pointing at Work instead of the full `WorkAccessEmptyState` panel.
  - The Workspaces page no longer repeats the notification inbox that Attention already shows; it shows an unread count linking to Attention.

- dd4389b: Let React artifacts show live data and charts. An artifact can declare read-only connector reads in a leading `<bindings>` block and read them with `usePolychatData` from `@polychat/data`. The host runs each read through the API, which takes the declaration from the stored message, refuses operations that change anything, only lets a refetch change declared arguments, caches results for a minute and rate-limits each artifact. React artifacts now compile with Sucrase instead of Babel standalone, can import `recharts`, and are assembled without string replacement, so `$` sequences and `</script>` in component source no longer corrupt the page.
- ee31a6d: Call the Poly by its name everywhere. The `meta` conversation type is now `poly`, the `meta_assistant` request field is now `poly`, and the meta assistant contracts, prompts, tools, hooks and overlay are renamed to match (`POLY_NAVIGATION_TOOL_NAMES`, `polyRequestSchema`, `buildPolyPrompt`, `PolyOverlay`, `usePolyNavigation`). A data migration moves stored `meta` conversations to `poly`. Behaviour is unchanged.
- 462cbe7: Keep long-lived tabs current. Builds now publish `version.json` with their build id, and an open tab checks it when it becomes visible and every half hour, offering a refresh when a newer build is live. A chunk that fails to load after a deploy reloads the page once, with a cooldown so a broken build cannot loop, and a waiting service worker now offers the same refresh instead of only logging.
- a8cf8a8: Give Work projects an overview page and consistent section navigation.

  - The project home shows open tasks, with anything blocked or waiting for review listed first, plus a preview of the project brief beside its conversations. `ProjectTasksSummary` was already built but not used anywhere, and the brief was only visible in Settings.
  - Project section tabs now read Overview · Tasks · Files · Activity, with a More menu for Teammates, Scheduled, Plugins and Settings, which were previously reachable only from the sidebar.
  - The Activity page uses the shared project header, so its tabs match the other project pages. `ProjectActivity` now takes `workspaceId`.
  - "Add a task" on the overview opens the task board with the create dialog already open (`?new=1`).
  - `component-workspaces` exports a new `ProjectBriefPreview`.
  - Teammates, Scheduled, Plugins and Settings now show the project tabs as well: `CapabilityLibrary`, `ScheduledLibrary` and `PluginsLibrary` accept an optional `navigation` slot. On Settings the tabs replace the "Back to project" link.

### Minor Changes

- 4789c96: Give the desktop window the Apps place, and share one app runtime with the web application.

  Apps was the last Chat route the desktop answered with a 404. The runtimes behind it — Notes, Articles, Recordings, Strudel, the image studio, Replicate and fine-tuning — were already thin compositions over `component-experiences` and `library-react`, but the compositions themselves lived in `apps/app` where nothing else could reach them.

  `component-shell` now owns `AppRoute`, `AppRuntime` and every runtime it dispatches to, so both hosts open the same apps from the same code and `/chat/apps/:appId/*` works in the desktop window.

  `component-experiences` declares the `@strudel/*` packages its music surface imports at runtime. They previously resolved only because `apps/app` happened to declare them and pnpm hoisted them into reach; a second consumer would have bundled a broken dynamic import.

- 4789c96: Give the desktop window the Files place, and share one implementation with the web application.

  Files was one of three places the shared sidebar links to that the desktop answered with a 404. The libraries behind it — sources, outputs and memory documents — already lived in shared packages; only the pages composing them were stranded in `apps/app`.

  `component-shell` now owns `FilesPage` with its Made, Given and Memory libraries, the connected `SignInEmptyState`, the connected `ResponseRenderer`, and `ChatPlaceShell` — the sidebar-and-scroll frame the web chat layout used to spell out inline and the desktop needed to repeat. `SignInEmptyState` asks the shell host to open sign-in rather than reaching for the web login modal, so the desktop opens its own browser sign-in from the same empty state.

- 4789c96: Give the desktop window the Teammates place, the teammate editor and the tool runner.

  Teammates was the last of the three places the shared sidebar links to that the desktop answered with a 404, and it carried the largest tail: the capability library and its dialogs, the recipe workflow controller, the connector setup dialogs and the teammate editor all lived in `apps/app`.

  They move into `component-shell` unchanged, and both hosts render the same library, the same hire, share and skill dialogs, and the same connector setup. `library-react` publishes `NEW_TEAMMATE_ID` beside `getTeammateEditorPath`, so the constant belongs with the paths that use it rather than to whichever page happened to define it.

  The desktop still answers 404 for `/chat/apps/:appId`, which needs the application runtimes rather than the capability library.

- 4789c96: Let anyone sign out from the shell, and let the desktop window sign out at all.

  The desktop application had a `sign_out` command in Rust that nothing ever called. A signed-in window held its session in the operating system keychain with no way to give it back, so the only way off an account was to delete the credential by hand. On the web, signing out was buried in the profile page.

  The sidebar settings popover now carries a sign-out entry beside the account links, and `ShellHost` gains a required `signOut` so each host does what signing out means for it: the web ends the session through the API, and the desktop ends it through the API _and_ forgets the keychain entry, so a window that cannot reach the API still stops holding the credential.

### Patch Changes

- 505ce6a: Give the desktop window every page the web application serves.

  The desktop had the Chat places and nothing else. Work went nowhere, because its connected containers lived in `apps/app` where only the web could reach them, and the same was true of the conversation home, Profile, Models, Discover, Pets, Pricing and the legal pages. The mode toggle, the Discover section and the settings popover all linked to routes the window answered with a 404.

  - The connected Work containers, the conversation home, Profile, Models, Discover, Pets, Pricing and the legal pages moved into `component-shell` beside the Chat places they already shared. `WorkPlaceShell` is the Work frame, reading the workspace and project from the route the way `ChatPlaceShell` reads the Chat place.
  - The desktop registers a page directory for each of them, so every link either host renders now resolves in both.
  - Ask Poly and the project picker moved into a shared `ShellDialogs` the desktop mounts through `ShellHostProvider`, and the desktop drops the throwing placeholder it used for Ask Poly.
  - The desktop wraps its routes in the shared error page, so a render failure explains itself instead of leaving a blank window.
  - `polychat://` links reach Work, Profile and Discover as well as Chat, which is what the attention notifications the window already raises point at.
  - The window title names the open place rather than staying "Polychat".
  - House fonts and built-in pet sheets ship inside `component-ui` and resolve through each host's bundler, replacing the static `/fonts` and `/pets` directory the desktop reached by symlink.

- 505ce6a: Let the desktop window turn its own task notifications on.

  Task notification settings only knew how a browser delivers. The switch asked for browser permission, waited for a `platform: "web"` push registration against this installation, and disabled every category until one existed. The desktop window has no service worker and never registers, so the switch sat disabled, `preferences.enabled` could never become true, and the local notifications and icon badge the Rust core already knows how to raise stayed silent — even though the window polls Attention for exactly that purpose.

  How a device delivers is now a host concern. `ShellHost` carries a `useTaskNotificationChannel` hook: the web passes `useWebPushTaskNotificationChannel`, which keeps the permission, registration and retry behaviour it had, and the desktop passes `useDeviceTaskNotificationChannel`, which only flips the account preference because the running window is the delivery. The categories are shared either way and read the same server preferences through `useTaskNotificationPreferences`.

  The desktop icon badge follows the same switch, so turning task notifications off clears it rather than leaving a count behind.

- 34380a3: Fix the defects a review of the desktop and web shells turned up.

  **The desktop window could white-screen instead of showing its error page.** `getCurrentWindow()` reads `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` synchronously, so it throws outright wherever the renderer runs without the Tauri host — `dev:renderer`, for one. The window-title effect called it on every navigation, and it ran in `DesktopShellHost`, one level _above_ the error boundary, so nothing caught it and no exception was reported. The native title is now set only when the Tauri runtime is present, and the window's own effects moved inside the boundary alongside the routes.

  **The error page trapped the window on it.** `AppErrorBoundary` never cleared its error, so "Back to the nest" changed the URL and kept rendering the same error. It now resets when the location changes.

  **A pet sheet url could resolve to an inherited property.** `resolvePetSheetUrl` looked the url up on a plain object, so an account whose sheet url was `constructor` or `toString` got a function stringified into `background-image`. It reads from a `Map` now.

  **The Work sidebar re-rendered on every streamed token in the app.** It subscribed to the whole `streams` map, which every stream mutator replaces, so each token re-ran its conversation grouping and rebuilt the sidebar. It now watches only the statuses of the conversations it lists.

  **A project conversation rebuilt its whole thread config on every render.** The `modeConfig` handed to the thread was an inline literal, and `useFileMessageAsTask` returned a fresh object each render, so `requestOptions` changed identity on every streamed chunk and tore down the chat manager's callbacks with it. Both are memoised, so the config is stable while a response streams.

  **The conversation home rebuilt its mode config needlessly, and missed an entitlement change.** `HomePage`'s host/chat merge is memoised, and `useHomeChatModeConfig` now lists `isPro`, which it reads to decide which composer commands to offer but had omitted from its dependencies.

  **The desktop rebuilt its whole place shell on every navigation.** Each page wrapped itself in `ChatPlaceShell` or `WorkPlaceShell`, so moving between two pages of the same place unmounted the sidebar and, in Work, the workspace and project context with it — where the web keeps them mounted through a layout route. A page now declares which place it belongs to and the desktop router mounts that shell once around the group.

  **Notification delivery is chosen by a component rather than a hook passed as a value.** `ShellHost` carried `useTaskNotificationChannel`, a hook stored on an object and called dynamically, which the linter flagged as unverifiable. Each host now supplies a `TaskNotificationSettings` component bound to its own channel, matching how `HostDialogs` already works.

  **The desktop announced attention on every poll.** The attention query returns a fresh array every 15 seconds, so the window sent the whole list to its Rust core each time and relied on the ledger there to stay quiet. It now skips the call when the set of waiting items has not changed, keyed by account so switching accounts still announces.

- 4789c96: Give the desktop window the Attention place.

  Attention is the second of the three places the shared sidebar links to that the desktop answered with a 404. The page was already built entirely from shared packages, so it moves from `apps/app` into `component-shell` unchanged and both hosts render the same one.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 42c36ea: Release the applications from changesets. Merging a changeset that names an application versions it, tags it and publishes a GitHub release with its changelog entry; the desktop release also carries macOS, Windows and Linux archives built on their own runners. The API serves those archives from `/desktop/downloads` and answers the desktop updater from `/desktop/releases`, so neither the website nor the application needs to know where the builds are hosted.
- f440eb7: Collapse the seven sandbox tools into one `run_sandbox_task` with a `taskType` argument, and add a `sandbox-tasks` skill covering how to pick the type and write a task an unattended run can complete. `run_feature_implementation`, `run_code_review`, `run_test_suite`, `run_bug_fix`, `run_refactoring`, `run_documentation` and `run_migration` are removed.
- 7d3c809: Share one connected navigation shell between the web and desktop applications.

  `component-shell` is a new package holding the wiring layer that previously lived only in `apps/app`: the chat sidebar with its conversation list and menus, the product and conversation headers, the page and product shells, global search, the settings popover and the not-found page. It is the single exception to the router-, store- and client-free rule for `component-*` packages, because connecting the controlled presentation in `component-navigation` and `component-ui` to the stores and router is its whole job.

  What differs between hosts arrives through `ShellHostProvider`: the origin public share links point at, the dialogs a host owns alone, and the actions that open them. A host that has not migrated an action supplies one that throws, so a gap stays visible instead of becoming a control that quietly does nothing.

  `library-react` publishes `DISCOVER_PATH` alongside the existing place paths, and `library-client` publishes `WEB_APP_BASE_URL` so a host without a web origin can still build share links.

  `component-conversation` drops `ConversationHeader`. It was the desktop's stand-in for a real header and is replaced by the shared `ConversationProductHeader`.

- f440eb7: Retrieval becomes a tool the model calls. `search_documents` searches the user's own material and returns passages; the `use_rag` request flag, the composer toggle and the RAG settings panel are removed, along with the prompt augmentation that fired on every message whether or not the turn needed it.

  Memory recall splits cleanly: the synthesis stays in the prompt because it is short and always relevant, and per-turn similarity search gives way to `search_memories`, which the model calls when it needs a specific memory.

  Conversation titles are generated as post-turn server work and arrive on the stream, so a first turn no longer costs an extra client round trip. The client still titles conversations the server does not store.
