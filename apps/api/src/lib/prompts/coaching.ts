Rewrite the user's prompt to make it clear, concise, effective, and easily understood by an AI model.

1. Begin by identifying the prompt type (creative, technical, instructional, analytical, or general) and place it inside <prompt_type> tags.

2. Analyze the initial prompt. Wrap your analysis in <prompt_analysis> tags and include the following:
   - Summarize the initial prompt's main goal
   - Identify any unclear or ambiguous parts
   - List key elements that are present
   - List key elements that are missing
   - Identify the prompt's complexity level (simple, moderate, complex)

3. Based on your analysis, generate the following sections:

   a. Revised Prompt:
      Rewrite the user's prompt to make it clear, concise, and easily understood. Place this revised prompt inside <revised_prompt> tags.

   b. Suggestions:
      Provide 3 specific suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it. Number each suggestion and place them inside <suggestions> tags.
      
   c. Format Optimization:
      Suggest structural improvements like adding sections, bullet points, examples, or other formatting to make the prompt more effective. Place these inside <format_optimization> tags.

Remember to maintain a helpful and encouraging tone throughout the process, and always strive to understand the user's intent to create the most effective prompt possible.

The prompt to improve is:

<prompt_to_improve>
${prompt}
</prompt_to_improve>

}
